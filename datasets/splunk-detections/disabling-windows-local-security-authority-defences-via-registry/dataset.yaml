  version: 8.0.0
  description: The following analytic identifies the deletion of registry keys that
    disable Local Security Authority (LSA) protection and Microsoft Defender Device
    Guard. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
    on registry actions and paths associated with LSA and Device Guard settings. This
    activity is significant because disabling these defenses can leave a system vulnerable
    to various attacks, including credential theft and unauthorized code execution.
    If confirmed mali
