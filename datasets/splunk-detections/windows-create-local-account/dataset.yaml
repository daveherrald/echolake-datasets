  description: The following analytic detects the creation of a new local user account
    on a Windows system. It leverages Windows Security Audit logs, specifically event
    ID 4720, to identify this activity. Monitoring the creation of local accounts
    is crucial for a SOC as it can indicate unauthorized access or lateral movement
    within the network. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker
    to establish persistence, escalate privileges, or gain unauthorized access to
    sensitive systems and data.
