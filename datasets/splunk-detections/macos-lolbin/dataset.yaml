  description: 'The following analytic detects multiple executions of Living off the
    Land (LOLbin) binaries on macOS within a short period. It leverages osquery to
    monitor process events and identifies commands such as "find", "crontab", "screencapture",
    "openssl", "curl", "wget", "killall", and "funzip". This activity is significant
    as LOLbins are often used by attackers to perform malicious actions while evading
    detection. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute
    arbitrary code, '
