  description: The following analytic identifies when the allowed domain settings
    for O365 SharePoint have been changed. With Azure AD B2B collaboration, users
    and administrators can invite external users to collaborate with internal users.
    External guest account invitations may also need access to OneDrive/SharePoint
    resources. These changed should be monitored by security teams as they could potentially
    lead to unauthorized access.
