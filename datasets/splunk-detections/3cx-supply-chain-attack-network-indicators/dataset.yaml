  description: 'The following analytic identifies DNS queries to domains associated
    with the 3CX supply chain attack. It leverages the Network_Resolution datamodel
    to detect these suspicious domain indicators. This activity is significant because
    it can indicate a potential compromise stemming from the 3CX supply chain attack,
    which is known for distributing malicious software through trusted updates. If
    confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to establish a foothold
    in the network, exfiltrate '
