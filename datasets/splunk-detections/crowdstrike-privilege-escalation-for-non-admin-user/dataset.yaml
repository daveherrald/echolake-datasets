  description: The following analytic detects CrowdStrike alerts for privilege escalation
    attempts by non-admin users. These alerts indicate unauthorized efforts by regular
    users to gain elevated permissions, posing a significant security risk. Detecting
    and addressing these attempts promptly helps prevent potential breaches and ensures
    that user privileges remain properly managed, maintaining the integrity of the
    organization's security protocols.
