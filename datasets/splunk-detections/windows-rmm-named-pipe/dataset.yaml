  description: 'The following analytic detects the creation or connection to known
    suspicious named pipes, which is a technique often used by offensive tools.

    It leverages Sysmon EventCodes 17 and 18 to identify  known default pipe names
    used by RMM tools.

    If confirmed malicious,  this could allow an attacker to abuse these to potentially
    gain persistence, command and control, or further system compromise.
