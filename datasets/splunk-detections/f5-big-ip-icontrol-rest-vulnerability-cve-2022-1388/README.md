# F5 BIG-IP iControl REST Vulnerability CVE-2022-1388

**Type:** TTP

**Author:** Michael Haag, Splunk

## Description

This dataset contains sample data for detecting attempts to exploit the F5 BIG-IP iControl REST API vulnerability (CVE-2022-1388) for unauthenticated remote code execution. It identifies suspicious URI paths and POST HTTP methods, along with specific request headers containing potential commands in the `utilcmdargs` field and a random base64 encoded value in the `X-F5-Auth-Token` field. This activity is significant as it targets a critical vulnerability that can allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full system compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive data.
