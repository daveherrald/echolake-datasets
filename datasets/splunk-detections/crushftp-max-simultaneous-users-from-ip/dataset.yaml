  version: 2.0.0
  description: The following analytic identifies instances where CrushFTP has blocked
    access due to exceeding the maximum number of simultaneous connections from a
    single IP address. This activity may indicate brute force attempts, credential
    stuffing, or automated attacks against the CrushFTP server. This detection is
    particularly relevant following the discovery of CVE-2025-31161, an authentication
    bypass vulnerability in CrushFTP versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through
    11.3.0.
