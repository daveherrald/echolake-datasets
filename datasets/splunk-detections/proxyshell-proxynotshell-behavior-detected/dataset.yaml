  description: The following analytic identifies potential exploitation of Windows
    Exchange servers via ProxyShell or ProxyNotShell vulnerabilities, followed by
    post-exploitation activities such as running nltest, Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz,
    and adding new users. It leverages data from multiple analytic stories, requiring
    at least five distinct sources to trigger, thus reducing noise. This activity
    is significant as it indicates a high likelihood of an active compromise, potentially
    leading to unauthorized access
