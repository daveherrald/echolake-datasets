  description: The following analytic detects the suspicious add user account type.
    This behavior is critical for a SOC to monitor because it may indicate attempts
    to gain unauthorized access or maintain control over a system. Such actions could
    be signs of malicious activity. If confirmed, this could lead to serious consequences,
    including a compromised system, unauthorized access to sensitive data, or even
    a wider breach affecting the entire network. Detecting and responding to these
    signs early is essential
