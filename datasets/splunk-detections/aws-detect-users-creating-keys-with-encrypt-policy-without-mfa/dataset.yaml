  description: The following analytic detects the creation of AWS KMS keys with an
    encryption policy accessible to everyone, including external entities. It leverages
    AWS CloudTrail logs to identify `CreateKey` or `PutKeyPolicy` events where the
    `kms:Encrypt` action is granted to all principals. This activity is significant
    as it may indicate a compromised account, allowing an attacker to misuse the encryption
    key to target other organizations. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to
    unauthorized data encry
