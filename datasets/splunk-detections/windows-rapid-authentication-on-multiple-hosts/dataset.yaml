  description: The following analytic detects a source computer authenticating to
    30 or more remote endpoints within a 5-minute timespan using Event ID 4624. This
    behavior is identified by analyzing Windows Event Logs for LogonType 3 events
    and counting unique target computers. Such activity is significant as it may indicate

    sensitive data a
