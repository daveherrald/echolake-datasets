  description: 'The following analytic detects the creation or enabling of services
    on Linux platforms using the systemctl or service tools. It leverages Endpoint
    Detection and Response (EDR) logs, focusing on process names, parent processes,
    and command-line executions. This activity is significant as adversaries may create
    or modify services to maintain persistence or execute malicious payloads. If confirmed
    malicious, this behavior could lead to persistent access, data theft, ransomware
    deployment, or other '
