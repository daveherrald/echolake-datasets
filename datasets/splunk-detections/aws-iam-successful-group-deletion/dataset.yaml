  description: 'The following analytic identifies the successful deletion of an IAM
    group in AWS. It leverages CloudTrail logs to detect `DeleteGroup` events with
    a success status. This activity is significant as it could indicate potential
    changes in user permissions or access controls, which may be a precursor to further
    unauthorized actions. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could disrupt access
    management, potentially leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized access
    to sensitive resources. Analysts '
