  description: The following analytic identifies the execution of applications or
    scripts from uncommon or suspicious file paths, potentially indicating malware
    or unauthorized activity. It leverages Windows AppLocker event logs and uses statistical
    analysis to detect anomalies. By calculating the average and standard deviation
    of execution counts per file path, it flags paths with execution counts significantly
    higher than expected. This behavior is significant as it can uncover malicious
    activities or policy
