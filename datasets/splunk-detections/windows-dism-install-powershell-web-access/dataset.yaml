  description: The following analytic detects the installation of PowerShell Web Access
    using the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool. It leverages
    Sysmon EventID 1 to identify the execution of `dism.exe` with specific parameters
    related to enabling the WindowsPowerShellWebAccess feature. This activity is significant
    because enabling PowerShell Web Access can facilitate remote execution of PowerShell
    commands, potentially allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to systems
    and network
