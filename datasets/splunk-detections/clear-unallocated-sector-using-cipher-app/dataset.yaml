  description: The following analytic detects the execution of `cipher.exe` with the
    `/w` flag to clear unallocated sectors on a disk. It leverages data from Endpoint
    Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, command-line arguments,
    and parent processes. This activity is significant because it is a technique used
    by ransomware to prevent forensic recovery of deleted files. If confirmed malicious,
    this action could hinder incident response efforts by making it impossible to
    recover critica
