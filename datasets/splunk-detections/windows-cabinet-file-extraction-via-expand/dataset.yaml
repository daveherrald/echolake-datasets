  description: 'Detects usage of expand.exe to extract Microsoft Cabinet (CAB) archives,
    with

    emphasis on extractions into `C:\\ProgramData` or similar staging locations. In

    recent APT37 activity, a CAB payload (e.g., wonder.cab) was expanded into

    ProgramData prior to persistence and execution. This behavior is a strong signal

    for ingress tool transfer and staging of payloads.
