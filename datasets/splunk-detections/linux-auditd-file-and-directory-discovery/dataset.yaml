  description: 'The following analytic detects suspicious file and directory discovery
    activities, which may indicate an attacker''s effort to locate sensitive documents
    and files on a compromised system. This behavior often precedes data exfiltration,
    as adversaries seek to identify valuable or confidential information for theft.
    By identifying unusual or unauthorized attempts to browse or enumerate files and
    directories, this analytic helps security teams detect potential reconnaissance
    or preparatory actions '
