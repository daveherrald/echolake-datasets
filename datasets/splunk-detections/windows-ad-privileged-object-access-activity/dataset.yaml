  description: The following analytic detects access attempts to privileged Active
    Directory objects, such as Domain Admins or Enterprise Admins. It leverages Windows
    Security Event Code 4662 to identify when these sensitive objects are accessed.

    normal users or processes, and unauthorized access attempts may indicate attacker
    enumeration or lateral movement within the domain. If confirmed malicious, this
    activity could allow attack
