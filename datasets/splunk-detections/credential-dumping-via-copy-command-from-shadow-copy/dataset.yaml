  description: The following analytic detects the use of the copy command to dump
    credentials from a shadow copy. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
    data to identify processes with command lines referencing critical files like
    "sam", "security", "system", and "ntds.dit" in system directories. This activity
    is significant as it indicates an attempt to extract credentials, a common technique
    for unauthorized access and privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, this
    could lead to attackers gai
