  description: This analytic detects an increase in modifications to AD groups or
    objects. Frequent changes to AD groups or objects can indicate potential security
    risks, such as unauthorized access attempts, impairing defences or establishing
    persistence. By monitoring AD logs for unusual modification patterns, this detection
    helps identify suspicious behavior that could compromise the integrity and security
    of the AD environment.
