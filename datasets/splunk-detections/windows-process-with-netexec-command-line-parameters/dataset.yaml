  description: 'The following analytic detects the use of NetExec (formally CrackmapExec)
    a toolset used for post-exploitation enumeration and attack within Active Directory
    environments through command line parameters. It leverages Endpoint Detection
    and Response (EDR) data to identify specific command-line arguments associated
    with actions like ticket manipulation, kerberoasting, and password spraying. This
    activity is significant as NetExec is used by adversaries to exploit Kerberos
    for privilege escalation '
