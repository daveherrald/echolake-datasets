# JetBrains TeamCity Authentication Bypass CVE-2024-27198

**Type:** TTP

**Author:** Michael Haag, Splunk

## Description

This dataset contains sample data for identifying attempts to exploit the JetBrains TeamCity Authentication Bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-27198). It detects suspicious POST requests to the `/app/rest/users` and `/app/rest/users/id:1/tokens` endpoints, which are indicative of attempts to create new administrator users or generate admin access tokens without authentication. This detection leverages the Web datamodel and CIM-compliant log sources, such as Nginx or TeamCity logs. This activity is significant as it can lead to full control over the TeamCity server, including all projects, builds, agents, and artifacts. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain unauthorized administrative access, leading to severe security breaches.
