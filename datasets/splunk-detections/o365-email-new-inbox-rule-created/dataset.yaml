  description: The following analytic identifies the creation of new email inbox rules
    in an Office 365 environment. It detects events logged under New-InboxRule and
    Set-InboxRule operations within the o365_management_activity data source, focusing
    on parameters that may indicate mail forwarding, removal, or obfuscation. Inbox
    rule creation is a typical end-user activity however attackers also leverage this
    technique for multiple reasons.
