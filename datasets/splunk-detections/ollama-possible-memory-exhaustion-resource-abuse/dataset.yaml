  description: 'Detects abnormal memory allocation patterns and excessive runner operations
    in Ollama that may indicate resource exhaustion attacks, memory abuse through
    malicious model loading, or attempts to degrade system performance by overwhelming
    GPU/CPU resources. Adversaries may deliberately load multiple large models, trigger
    repeated model initialization cycles, or exploit memory allocation mechanisms
    to exhaust available system resources, causing denial of service conditions or
    degrading performance '
