  description: The following analytic identifies failed attempts to delete AWS IAM
    groups. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to detect events where the DeleteGroup
    action fails due to errors like NoSuchEntityException, DeleteConflictException,
    or AccessDenied. This activity is significant as it may indicate unauthorized
    attempts to modify IAM group configurations, which could be a precursor to privilege
    escalation or other malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, this could allow
    an attacker to disrupt IAM po
