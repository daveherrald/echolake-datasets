  description: The following analytic identifies the execution of common Linux processes
    used for elevation control, such as `chmod`, `chown`, and `setuid`. It leverages
    data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names
    and command-line executions. This activity is significant because these processes
    are often abused by adversaries to gain persistence or escalate privileges on
    compromised hosts. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers
    to modify file attribute
