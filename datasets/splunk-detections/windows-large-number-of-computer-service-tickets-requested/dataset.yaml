  description: 'The following analytic detects a high volume of Kerberos service ticket
    requests, specifically more than 30, from a single source within a 5-minute window.
    It leverages Event ID 4769, which logs when a Kerberos service ticket is requested,
    focusing on requests with computer names as the Service Name. This behavior is
    significant as it may indicate malicious activities such as lateral movement,
    malware staging, or reconnaissance. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could
    gain unauthorized access '
