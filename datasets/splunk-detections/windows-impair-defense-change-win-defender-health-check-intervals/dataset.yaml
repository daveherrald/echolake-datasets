  description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
    that change the health check interval of Windows Defender. It leverages data from
    the Endpoint datamodel, specifically monitoring changes to the "ServiceKeepAlive"
    registry path with a value of "0x00000001". This activity is significant because
    altering Windows Defender settings can impair its ability to perform timely health
    checks, potentially leaving the system vulnerable. If confirmed malicious, this
    could allow an attacker
