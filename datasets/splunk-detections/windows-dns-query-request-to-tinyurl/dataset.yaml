  description: "The following analytic detects a process located in a potentially\
    \ suspicious location making DNS queries to known URL shortening services, specifically\
    \ tinyurl.\nURL shorteners are frequently used by threat actors to obfuscate malicious\
    \ destinations, including phishing pages, malware distribution sites, or command-and-control\
    \ (C2) endpoints. \nWhile tinyurl.com is a legitimate service, its use in enterprise\
    \ environments—particularly by non-browser processes or scripts—should be considered\
    \ suspicio"
