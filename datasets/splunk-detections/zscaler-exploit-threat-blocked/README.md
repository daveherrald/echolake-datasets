# Zscaler Exploit Threat Blocked

**Type:** TTP

**Author:** Rod Soto, Gowthamaraj Rajendran, Splunk

## Description

This dataset contains sample data for identifying potential exploit attempts involving command and script interpreters blocked by Zscaler. It leverages web proxy logs to detect incidents where actions are blocked due to exploit references. The detection compiles statistics by user, threat name, URL, hostname, file class, and filename. This activity is significant as it helps identify and mitigate exploit attempts, which are critical for maintaining security. If confirmed malicious, such activity could lead to unauthorized code execution, privilege escalation, or persistent access within the environment, posing a severe threat to organizational security.
