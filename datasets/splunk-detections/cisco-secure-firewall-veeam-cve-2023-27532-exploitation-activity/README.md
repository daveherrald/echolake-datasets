**Type:** TTP

**Author:** Nasreddine Bencherchali, Splunk, Talos NTDR

## Description

This analytic detects exploitation activity of CVE-2023-27532 using Cisco Secure Firewall Intrusion Events. 
It leverages Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense IntrusionEvent logs to identify cases where Snort signature 61514 (Veeam Backup and Replication credential dump attempt) 
is followed within a 5-minute window by 64795 (Veeam Backup and Replication xp_cmdshell invocation attempt), which detects the use of `xp_cmdshell`, a common post-exploitation technique. 
If confirmed malicious, this behavior is highly indicative of a successful exploitation of CVE-2023-27532, followed by remote command execution or credential dumping.
