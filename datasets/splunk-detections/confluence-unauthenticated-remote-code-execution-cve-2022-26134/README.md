# Confluence Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution CVE-2022-26134

**Type:** TTP

**Author:** Michael Haag, Splunk

## Description

This dataset contains sample data for detecting attempts to exploit CVE-2022-26134, an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Confluence. It leverages the Web datamodel to analyze network and CIM-compliant web logs, identifying suspicious URL patterns and parameters indicative of exploitation attempts. This activity is significant as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Confluence server without authentication, potentially leading to full system compromise. If confirmed malicious, this could result in unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network. Immediate investigation and remediation are crucial to prevent extensive damage.
