  description: 'This analytic detects suspicious use of ''mshta.exe'' or ''rundll32.exe''
    invoking ''mshtml.dll''

    or the ''RunHTMLApplication'' export without including a direct HTTP/HTTPS URL
    in the command line.

    This pattern could be associated with obfuscated script execution used by threat
    actors during

    initial access or payload staging. The absence of a visible URL may indicate attempts
    to evade static

    detections by embedding the URL via string concatenation, encoding (e.g., hex),
    or indirect script loaders
