  name: wbadmin-delete-system-backups
  version: 10.0.0
  description: The following analytic detects the execution of wbadmin.exe with flags
    that delete backup files, specifically targeting catalog or system state backups.
    It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
    on process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because
    it is commonly used by ransomware to prevent recovery by deleting system backups.
    If confirmed malicious, this action could severely hinder recovery efforts, leading
    to prolonged downtime
