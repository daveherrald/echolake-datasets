  description: The following analytic detects when a content search is initiated within
    the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center. It leverages the SearchCreated
    operation from the o365_management_activity logs under the SecurityComplianceCenter
    workload. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to access
    sensitive organizational data, including emails and documents. If confirmed malicious,
    this could lead to unauthorized data access, potential data exfiltration, and
    compliance violations
