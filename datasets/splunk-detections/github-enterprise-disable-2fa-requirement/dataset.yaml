  description: The following analytic detects when two-factor authentication (2FA)
    requirements are disabled in GitHub Enterprise. The detection monitors GitHub
    Enterprise audit logs for 2FA requirement changes by tracking actor details, organization
    information, and associated metadata. For a SOC, identifying disabled 2FA requirements
    is critical as it could indicate attempts to weaken account security controls.
    Two-factor authentication is a fundamental security control that helps prevent
    unauthorized access
