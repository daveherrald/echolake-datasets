  description: The following analytic detects potential exploitation attempts on publicly
    accessible PaperCut NG servers. It identifies connections from public IP addresses
    to the server, specifically monitoring URI paths commonly used in proof-of-concept
    scripts for exploiting PaperCut NG vulnerabilities. This detection leverages web
    traffic data from the `Web` datamodel, focusing on specific URI paths and excluding
    internal IP ranges. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt
    to exploit know
