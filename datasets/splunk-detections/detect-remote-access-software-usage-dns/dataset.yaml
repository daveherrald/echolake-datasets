  description: The following analytic detects DNS queries to domains associated with
    known remote access software such as AnyDesk, GoToMyPC, LogMeIn, and TeamViewer.
    This detection is crucial as adversaries often use these tools to maintain access
    and control over compromised environments. Identifying such behavior is vital
    for a Security Operations Center (SOC) because unauthorized remote access can
    lead to data breaches, ransomware attacks, and other severe impacts if these threats
    are not mitigated promptly
