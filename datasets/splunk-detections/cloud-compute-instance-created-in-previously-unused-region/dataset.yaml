  description: The following analytic detects the creation of a cloud compute instance
    in a region that has not been previously used within the last hour. It leverages
    cloud infrastructure logs and compares the regions of newly created instances
    against a lookup file of historically used regions. This activity is significant
    because the creation of instances in new regions can indicate unauthorized or
    suspicious activity, such as an attacker attempting to evade detection or establish
    a foothold in a less monit
