  description: The following analytic detects a CrowdStrike alert with MEDIUM severity
    indicates a potential threat that requires prompt attention. This alert level
    suggests suspicious activity that may compromise security but is not immediately
    critical. It typically involves detectable but non-imminent risks, such as unusual
    behavior or attempted policy violations, which should be investigated further
    and mitigated quickly to prevent escalation of attacks.
