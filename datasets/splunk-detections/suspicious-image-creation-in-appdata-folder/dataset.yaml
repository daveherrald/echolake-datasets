  description: The following analytic detects the creation of image files in the AppData
    folder by processes that also have a file reference in the same folder. It leverages

    with malware, such as the Remcos RAT, which captures screenshots and stores them
    in the AppData folder before exfiltrating them to a command-and-control server.
    If confirmed malicious
