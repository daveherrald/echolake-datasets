  description: 'The following analytic detects an Azure AD account successfully authenticating
    from multiple unique IP addresses within a 30-minute window. It leverages Azure
    AD SignInLogs to identify instances where the same user logs in from different
    IPs in a short time frame. This behavior is significant as it may indicate compromised
    credentials being used by an adversary, potentially following a phishing attack.
    If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow unauthorized access to corporate
    resources, '
