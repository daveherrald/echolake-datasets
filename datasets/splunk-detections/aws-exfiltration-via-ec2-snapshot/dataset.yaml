  version: 6.0.0
  description: The following analytic detects a series of AWS API calls related to
    EC2 snapshots within a short time window, indicating potential exfiltration via
    EC2 Snapshot modifications. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to identify actions
    such as creating, describing, and modifying snapshot attributes. This activity
    is significant as it may indicate an attacker attempting to exfiltrate data by
    sharing EC2 snapshots externally. If confirmed malicious, the attacker could gain
    access to sensitive information
