  description: The following analytic detects attempts to disable multi-factor authentication
    (MFA) for an AWS IAM user. It leverages Amazon Security Lake logs, specifically
    monitoring for `DeleteVirtualMFADevice` or `DeactivateMFADevice` API operations.
    This activity is significant as disabling MFA can indicate an adversary attempting
    to weaken account security to maintain persistence using a compromised account.
    If confirmed malicious, this action could allow attackers to retain access to
    the AWS environment
