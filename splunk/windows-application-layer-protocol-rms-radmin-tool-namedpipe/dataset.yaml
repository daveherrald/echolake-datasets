  description: The following analytic detects the use of default or publicly known
    named pipes associated with the RMX remote admin tool. It leverages Sysmon EventCodes
    17 and 18 to identify named pipe creation and connection events. This activity
    is significant as the RMX tool has been abused by adversaries and malware like
    Azorult to collect data from targeted hosts. If confirmed malicious, this could
    indicate unauthorized remote administration capabilities, leading to data exfiltration
    or further compromise
