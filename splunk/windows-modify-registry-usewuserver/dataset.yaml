  description: The following analytic detects a suspicious modification to the Windows
    Update configuration registry key "UseWUServer." It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry
    data model to identify changes where the registry value is set to "0x00000001."
    This activity is significant because it is commonly used by adversaries, including
    malware like RedLine Stealer, to bypass detection mechanisms and potentially exploit
    zero-day vulnerabilities. If confirmed malicious, this modification could allow
    attack
