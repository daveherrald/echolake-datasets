  description: The following analytic identifies potential enumeration of local network
    configuration on Linux systems. It detects this activity by monitoring processes
    such as "arp," "ifconfig," "ip," "netstat," "firewall-cmd," "ufw," "iptables,"
    "ss," and "route" within a 30-minute window. This behavior is significant as it
    often indicates reconnaissance efforts by adversaries to gather network information
    for subsequent attacks. If confirmed malicious, this activity could enable attackers
    to map the network
