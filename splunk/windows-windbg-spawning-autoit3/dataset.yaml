  description: The following analytic identifies instances of the WinDBG process spawning
    AutoIt3. This behavior is detected by monitoring endpoint telemetry for processes
    where 'windbg.exe' is the parent process and 'autoit3.exe' or similar is the child
    process. This activity is significant because AutoIt3 is frequently used by threat
    actors for scripting malicious automation, potentially indicating an ongoing attack.
    If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to automate tasks, execute
    arbitrary code
