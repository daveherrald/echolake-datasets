  description: This analytic detects instances where a user adds themselves to an
    Active Directory (AD) group. This activity is a common indicator of privilege
    escalation, where a user attempts to gain unauthorized access to higher privileges
    or sensitive resources. By monitoring AD logs, this detection identifies such
    suspicious behavior, which could be part of a larger attack strategy aimed at
    compromising critical systems and data.
