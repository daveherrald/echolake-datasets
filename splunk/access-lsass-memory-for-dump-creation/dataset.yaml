  description: The following analytic detects attempts to dump the LSASS process memory,
    a common technique in credential dumping attacks. It leverages Sysmon logs, specifically
    EventCode 10, to identify suspicious call traces to dbgcore.dll and dbghelp.dll
    associated with lsass.exe. This activity is significant as it often precedes the
    theft of sensitive login credentials, posing a high risk of unauthorized access
    to systems and data. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain access to critical
    credentials
