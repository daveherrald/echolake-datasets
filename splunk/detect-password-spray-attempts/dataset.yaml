  description: This analytic employs the 3-sigma approach to detect an unusual volume
    of failed authentication attempts from a single source. A password spray attack
    is a type of brute force attack where an attacker tries a few common passwords
    across many different accounts to avoid detection and account lockouts. By utilizing
    the Authentication Data Model, this detection is effective for all CIM-mapped
    authentication events, providing comprehensive coverage and enhancing security
    against these attacks.
