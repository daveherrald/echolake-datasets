  description: 'The following analytic detects the loading of `msi.dll` by a binary
    not located in `system32`, `syswow64`, `winsxs`, or `windows` directories. This
    is identified using Sysmon EventCode 7, which logs DLL loads, and filters out
    legitimate system paths. This activity is significant as it may indicate exploitation
    of CVE-2021-41379 or DLL side-loading attacks, both of which can lead to unauthorized
    system modifications. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to
    execute arbitrary code, '
