  description: The following analytic identifies when a new device is enrolled on
    an Okta account. It uses OktaIm2 logs ingested via the Splunk Add-on for Okta
    Identity Cloud to detect the creation of new device enrollments. This activity
    is significant as it may indicate a legitimate user setting up a new device or
    an adversary adding a device to maintain unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious,
    this could lead to potential account takeover, unauthorized access, and persistent
    control over the compromised
