  description: The following analytic detects accounts experiencing a high number
    of Single Sign-On (SSO) logon errors. It leverages data from the `o365_management_activity`
    dataset, focusing on failed user login attempts with SSO errors. This activity
    is significant as it may indicate brute-force attempts or the hijacking/reuse
    of SSO tokens. If confirmed malicious, attackers could potentially gain unauthorized
    access to user accounts, leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or further
    lateral movemen
