  description: The following analytic detects the creation of a Service Principal
    in an Azure AD environment. It leverages Azure Active Directory events ingested
    through EventHub, specifically monitoring the "Add service principal" operation.
    This activity is significant because Service Principals can be used by adversaries
    to establish persistence and bypass multi-factor authentication and conditional
    access policies. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to maintain
    single-factor access to the A
