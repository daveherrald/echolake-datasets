  description: 'The following analytic detects the modification of SSH Authorized
    Keys on Linux systems. It leverages process execution data from Endpoint Detection
    and Response (EDR) agents, specifically monitoring commands like "bash" and "cat"
    interacting with "authorized_keys" files. This activity is significant as adversaries
    often modify SSH Authorized Keys to establish persistent access to compromised
    endpoints. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to maintain
    unauthorized access, '
