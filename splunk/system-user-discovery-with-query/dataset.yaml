  description: The following analytic detects the execution of `query.exe` with command-line
    arguments aimed at discovering logged-in users. It leverages data from Endpoint
    Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line
    executions. This activity is significant as adversaries may use `query.exe` to
    gain situational awareness and perform Active Directory discovery on compromised
    endpoints. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to identify
    active users, aidin
