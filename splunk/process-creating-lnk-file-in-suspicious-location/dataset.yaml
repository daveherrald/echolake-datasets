  description: The following analytic detects a process creating a `.lnk` file in
    suspicious locations such as `C:\User*` or `*\Local\Temp\*`. It leverages filesystem
    and process activity data from the Endpoint data model to identify this behavior.
    This activity is significant because creating `.lnk` files in these directories
    is a common tactic used by spear phishing tools to establish persistence or execute
    malicious payloads. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to maintain
    persistence, exec
