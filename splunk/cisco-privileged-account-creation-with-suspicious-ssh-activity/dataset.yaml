  description: 'This analytic detects a correlation between privileged account creation
    on Cisco IOS devices and subsequent inbound SSH connections to non-standard ports
    or sshd_operns by correlating risk events

    This correlation identifies when both "Cisco IOS Suspicious Privileged Account
    Creation" and SSH-related Snort detections ("SSH Connection to sshd_operns" or
    "SSH Connection to Non-Standard Port") fire for the same network device.
