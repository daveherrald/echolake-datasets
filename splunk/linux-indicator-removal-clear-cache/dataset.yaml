  description: 'The following analytic detects processes that clear or free page cache
    on a Linux system. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing
    on specific command-line executions involving the kernel system request `drop_caches`.
    This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to delete forensic
    evidence or the presence of wiper malware like Awfulshred. If confirmed malicious,
    this behavior could allow an attacker to cover their tracks, making it difficult
    to investigate '
