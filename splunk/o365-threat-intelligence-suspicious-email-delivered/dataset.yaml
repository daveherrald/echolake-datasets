  description: The following analytic identifies when a suspicious email is detected
    within the Microsoft Office 365 ecosystem through the Advanced Threat Protection
    engine and delivered to an end user. Attackers may execute several attacks through
    email, any detections from built-in Office 365 capabilities should be monitored
    and responded to appropriately. Certain premium Office 365 capabilities such as
    Safe Attachment and Safe Links further enhance these detection and response functions.
