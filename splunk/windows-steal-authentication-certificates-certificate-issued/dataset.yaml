  description: The following analytic identifies the issuance of a new certificate
    by Certificate Services - AD CS, detected via Event ID 4887. This event logs the
    requester user context, DNS hostname of the requesting machine, and the request
    time. Monitoring this activity is crucial as it can indicate potential misuse
    of authentication certificates. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could use
    the issued certificate to impersonate users, escalate privileges, or maintain
    persistence within the environment. T
