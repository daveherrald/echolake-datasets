  description: The following analytic identifies when specific O365 advanced security
    settings are altered within the Office 365 tenant. If an attacker successfully
    disables O365 security settings, they can operate within the tenant with reduced
    risk of detection. This can lead to unauthorized data access, data exfiltration,
    account compromise, or other malicious activities without leaving a detailed audit
    trail.
