  description: 'The following analytic detects processes with command lines containing
    named pipes. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
    focusing on process command-line executions. This behavior is significant as it
    is often used by adversaries, such as those behind the Olympic Destroyer malware,
    for inter-process communication post-injection, aiding in defense evasion and
    privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers
    to maintain persistence, '
