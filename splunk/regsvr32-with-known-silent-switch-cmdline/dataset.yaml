  description: The following analytic detects the execution of Regsvr32.exe with the
    silent switch to load DLLs. This behavior is identified using Endpoint Detection
    and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on command-line executions containing the
    `-s` or `/s` switches. This activity is significant as it is commonly used in
    malware campaigns, such as IcedID, to stealthily load malicious DLLs. If confirmed
    malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, download additional
    payloads, and potent
