  description: The following analytic identifies processes querying the registry for
    potential passwords or credentials. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
    and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions that access specific
    registry paths known to store sensitive information. This activity is significant
    as it may indicate credential theft attempts, often used by adversaries or post-exploitation
    tools like winPEAS. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to privilege
    escalation,
