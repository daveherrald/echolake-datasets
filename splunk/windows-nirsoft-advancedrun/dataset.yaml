  description: 'The following analytic detects the execution of AdvancedRun.exe, a
    tool with capabilities similar to remote administration programs like PsExec.
    It identifies the process by its name or original file name and flags common command-line
    arguments. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
    (EDR) agents, focusing on process and command-line telemetry. Monitoring this
    activity is crucial as AdvancedRun can be used for remote code execution and configuration-based
    automation. '
