  description: The following analytic detects when the Microsoft Zero-hour Automatic
    Purge (ZAP) capability takes action against a user's mailbox. This capability
    is an enhanced protection feature that retro-actively removes email with known
    malicious content for user inboxes. Since this is a retroactive capability, there
    is still a window in which the user may fall victim to the malicious content.
