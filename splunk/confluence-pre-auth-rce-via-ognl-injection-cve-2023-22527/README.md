# Confluence Pre-Auth RCE via OGNL Injection CVE-2023-22527

**Type:** TTP

**Author:** Michael Haag, Splunk

## Description

The following analytic identifies attempts to exploit a critical template injection vulnerability (CVE-2023-22527) in outdated Confluence Data Center and Server versions. It detects POST requests to the "/template/aui/text-inline.vm" endpoint with HTTP status codes 200 or 202, indicating potential OGNL injection attacks. This activity is significant as it allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain full control over the affected Confluence instance, leading to data breaches, system compromise, and further network infiltration. Immediate patching is essential to mitigate this threat.
