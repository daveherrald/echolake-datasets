  description: The following analytic identifies all drivers being loaded on Windows
    systems using Sysmon EventCode 6 (Driver Load). It leverages fields such as driver
    path, signature status, and hash to detect potentially suspicious drivers. This
    activity is significant for a SOC as malicious drivers can be used to gain kernel-level
    access, bypass security controls, or persist in the environment. If confirmed
    malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with
    high privileges, lead
