  description: The following analytic detects the execution of "dsquery.exe" with
    arguments targeting `TrustedDomain` queries directly from the command line. This
    behavior is identified using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry,
    focusing on process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant
    as it often indicates domain trust discovery, a common step in lateral movement
    or privilege escalation by adversaries. If confirmed malicious, this could allow
    attackers to map domain trusts
