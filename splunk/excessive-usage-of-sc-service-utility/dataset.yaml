  description: The following analytic detects excessive usage of the `sc.exe` service
    utility on a host machine. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 1 logs to identify instances
    where `sc.exe` is executed more frequently than normal within a 15-minute window.
    This behavior is significant as it is commonly associated with ransomware, cryptocurrency
    miners, and other malware attempting to create, modify, delete, or disable services,
    potentially related to security applications or for privilege escalation. If confirmed
