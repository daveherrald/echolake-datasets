  description: 'The following analytic detects the deletion of cron jobs on a Linux
    machine. It leverages filesystem event logs to identify when files within the
    "/etc/cron.*" directory are deleted. This activity is significant because attackers
    or malware may delete cron jobs to disable scheduled security tasks or evade detection
    mechanisms. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow an attacker to disrupt
    system operations, evade security measures, or facilitate further malicious activities
    such as data '
