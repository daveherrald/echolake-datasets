  description: 'The following analytic detects a suspicious registry modification
    aimed at disabling security audit logs by adding a specific registry entry. It
    leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry data model, focusing on changes to the
    "Control\\MiniNt" registry path. This activity is significant because it can prevent
    Windows from logging any events to the Security Log, effectively blinding security
    monitoring efforts. If confirmed malicious, this technique could allow an attacker
    to operate undetected, '
