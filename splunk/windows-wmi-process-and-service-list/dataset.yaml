  description: The following analytic identifies suspicious WMI command lines querying
    for running processes or services. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and
    Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific process and command-line events. This
    activity is significant as adversaries often use WMI to gather system information
    and identify services on compromised machines. If confirmed malicious, this behavior
    could allow attackers to map out the system, identify critical services, and plan
    further attacks,
