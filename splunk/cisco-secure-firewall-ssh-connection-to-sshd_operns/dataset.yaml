  description: 'This analytic detects inbound SSH connections to the sshd_operns service
    on network devices using Cisco Secure Firewall Intrusion Events.

    APT actors have been observed enabling sshd_operns and opening it on non-standard
    ports to maintain encrypted remote access to compromised network infrastructure.

    This detection leverages Snort signature 65368 to identify connections to this
    service, which when combined with other indicators may signal persistent access
    mechanisms established by threat actors.'
