  description: The following analytic detects the creation or dropping of executable
    or script files in the root directory of a removable drive. It leverages data
    from the Endpoint.Filesystem datamodel, focusing on specific file types and their
    creation paths. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to
    spread malware, such as ransomware, via removable media. If confirmed malicious,
    this behavior could lead to unauthorized code execution, lateral movement, or
    persistence within the network, p
