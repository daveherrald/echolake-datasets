  description: The following analytic identifies one source failing to authenticate
    with 10 or more unique users. This behavior could represent an adversary performing
    a Password Spraying attack to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. This
    logic can be used for real time security monitoring as well as threat hunting
    exercises and works well against any number of data sources ingested into the
    CIM datamodel. Environments can be very different depending on the organization.
