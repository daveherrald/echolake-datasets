  description: The following analytic identifies the execution of `dsquery.exe` with
    command-line arguments used to query for domain groups. It leverages Endpoint
    Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on process names and command-line
    arguments. This activity is significant because both Red Teams and adversaries
    use `dsquery.exe` to enumerate domain groups, gaining situational awareness and
    facilitating further Active Directory discovery. If confirmed malicious, this
    behavior could allow attackers to map
