  description: The following analytic detects an unusual process execution pattern
    where a process running from C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ attempts to execute a binary
    from C:\Windows\System32\. In a typical Windows environment, 32-bit processes
    under SysWOW64 should primarily interact with 32-bit binaries within the same
    directory. However, an execution flow where a 32-bit process spawns a 64-bit binary
    from System32 can indicate potential process injection, privilege escalation,
    evasion techniques, or unauthorized
