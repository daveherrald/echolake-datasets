  description: The following analytic detects the assignment of privileged Azure Active
    Directory roles to a user. It leverages Azure AD audit logs, specifically monitoring
    the "Add member to role" operation. This activity is significant as adversaries
    may assign privileged roles to compromised accounts to maintain persistence within
    the Azure AD environment. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to
    escalate privileges, access sensitive information, and maintain long-term control
    over the Azure AD
