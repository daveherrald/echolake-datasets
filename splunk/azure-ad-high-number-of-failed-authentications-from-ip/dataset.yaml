  version: 11.0.0
  description: The following analytic detects an IP address with 20 or more failed
    authentication attempts to an Azure AD tenant within 10 minutes. It leverages
    Azure AD SignInLogs to identify repeated failed logins from the same IP. This
    behavior is significant as it may indicate a brute force attack aimed at gaining
    unauthorized access or escalating privileges. If confirmed malicious, the attacker
    could potentially compromise user accounts, leading to unauthorized access to
    sensitive information and resource
