  description: The following analytic detects suspicious usage of BitLockerToGo.exe,
    which has been observed being abused by Lumma stealer malware. The malware leverages
    this legitimate Windows utility to manipulate registry keys, search for cryptocurrency
    wallets and credentials, and exfiltrate sensitive data. This activity is significant
    because BitLockerToGo.exe provides functionality for viewing, copying, and writing
    files as well as modifying registry branches - capabilities that the Lumma stealer
    exploit
