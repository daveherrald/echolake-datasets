  version: 11.0.0
  description: The following analytic detects the creation of shadow copies using
    "wmic" or "Powershell" commands. It leverages the Endpoint.Processes data model
    in Splunk to identify processes where the command includes "shadowcopy" and "create".
    This activity is significant because it may indicate an attacker attempting to
    manipulate or access data in an unauthorized manner, potentially leading to data
    theft or manipulation. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers
    to backup and exfiltrate
