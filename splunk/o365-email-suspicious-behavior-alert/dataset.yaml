  description: The following analytic identifies when one of O365 the built-in security
    detections for suspicious email behaviors are triggered.  These alerts often indicate
    that an attacker may have compromised a mailbox within the environment. Any detections
    from built-in Office 365 capabilities should be monitored and responded to appropriately.
    Certain premium Office 365 capabilities further enhance these detection and response
    functions.
