  description: The following analytic detects when an application is used to connect
    a large number of unique ports/targets within a short time frame. Network enumeration
    may be used by adversaries as a method of discovery, lateral movement, or remote
    execution. This analytic may require significant tuning depending on the organization
    and applications being actively used, highly recommended to pre-populate the filter
    macro prior to activation.
