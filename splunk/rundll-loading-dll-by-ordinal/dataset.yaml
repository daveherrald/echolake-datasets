  description: The following analytic detects rundll32.exe loading a DLL export function
    by ordinal value. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
    agents, focusing on process command-line executions. This behavior is significant
    because adversaries may use rundll32.exe to execute malicious code while evading
    security tools that do not monitor this process. If confirmed malicious, this
    activity could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading
    to system compromise, privil
