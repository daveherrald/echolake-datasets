  description: The following analytic detects the execution of `netstat.exe` with
    command-line arguments to list network connections on a system. It leverages data
    from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names,
    command-line executions, and parent processes. This activity is significant as
    both Red Teams and adversaries use `netstat.exe` for situational awareness and
    Active Directory discovery. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow
    attackers to map network connections,
