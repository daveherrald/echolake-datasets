  description: The following analytic detects when Microsoft Office 365 Data Loss
    Prevention (DLP) rules have been triggered. DLP rules can be configured for any
    number of security, regulatory, or business compliance reasons, as such this analytic
    will only be as accurate as the upstream DLP configuration. Detections from this
    analytic should be evaluated thoroughly to de termine what, if any, security relevance
    the underlying DLP events contain.
