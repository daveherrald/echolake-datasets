  description: The following analytic identifies a LOLBAS process being executed where
    it's process name does not match it's original file name attribute. Processes
    that have been renamed and executed may be an indicator that an adversary is attempting
    to evade defenses or execute malicious code. The LOLBAS project documents Windows
    native binaries that can be abused by threat actors to perform tasks like executing
    malicious code.
