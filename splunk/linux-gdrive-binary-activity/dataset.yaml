  description: The following analytic detects the execution of the 'gdrive' tool on
    a Linux host. This tool allows standard users to perform tasks associated with
    Google Drive via the command line. This is used by actors to stage tools as well
    as exfiltrate data. The detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
    (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. If confirmed
    malicious, this could lead to compromise of systems or sensitive data being stolen.
