  description: The following analytic detects the creation of RAR Self-Extracting
    (SFX) files by monitoring the generation of file related to rar sfx .tmp file
    creation during sfx installation. This method leverages a heuristic to identify
    RAR SFX archives based on specific markers that indicate a combination of executable
    code and compressed RAR data. By tracking such activity, the analytic helps pinpoint
    potentially unauthorized or suspicious file creation events, which are often associated
    with malware pack
