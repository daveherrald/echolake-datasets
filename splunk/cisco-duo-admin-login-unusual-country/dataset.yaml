  description: The following analytic detects instances where a Duo admin login originates
    from a country outside of the United States, which may indicate suspicious or
    unauthorized access attempts. Please adjust as needed to your environment. It
    works by analyzing Duo activity logs for admin login actions and filtering out
    events where the access device's country is not within the expected region. By
    correlating user, device, browser, and location details, the analytic highlights
    anomalies in geographic login
