  description: The following analytic detects an AWS account successfully authenticating
    from multiple unique IP addresses within a 5-minute window. It leverages AWS CloudTrail
    logs, specifically monitoring `ConsoleLogin` events and counting distinct source
    IPs. This behavior is significant as it may indicate compromised credentials,
    potentially from a phishing attack, being used concurrently by an adversary and
    a legitimate user. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow unauthorized
    access to corpora
