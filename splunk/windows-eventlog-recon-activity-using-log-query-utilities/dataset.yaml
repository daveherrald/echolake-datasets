  description: This analytic detects EventLog reconnaissance activity using utilities
    such as `wevtutil.exe`, `wmic.exe`, PowerShell cmdlets like `Get-WinEvent`, or
    WMI queries targeting `Win32_NTLogEvent`. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
    and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments.
    These tools are often used by adversaries to extract usernames, IP addresses,
    session data, and event information for credential access or situational awareness
    during lateral movement.
