  description: This analytic detects instances where an internal host attempts to
    communicate with over 500 ports on a single destination IP address. It includes
    filtering criteria to exclude applications performing scans over ephemeral port
    ranges, focusing on potential reconnaissance or scanning activities. Monitoring
    network traffic logs allows for timely detection and response to such behavior,
    enhancing network security by identifying and mitigating potential threats promptly.
