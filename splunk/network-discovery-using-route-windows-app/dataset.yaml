  description: 'The following analytic detects the execution of the `route.exe` Windows
    application, commonly used for network discovery. It leverages data from Endpoint
    Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events. This
    activity is significant because adversaries often use `route.exe` to map network
    routes and identify potential targets within a network. If confirmed malicious,
    this behavior could allow attackers to gain insights into network topology, facilitating
    lateral movement '
