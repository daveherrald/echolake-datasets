  description: The following analytic identifies when a malicious file is detected
    within the SharePoint Online ecosystem. Attackers may stage and execute malicious
    files from within the Microsoft Office 365 ecosystem. Any detections from built-in
    Office 365 capabilities should be monitored and responded to appropriately. Certain
    premium Office 365 capabilities further enhance these detection and response functions.
