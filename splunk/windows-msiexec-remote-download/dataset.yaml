  description: 'The following analytic detects the use of msiexec.exe with an HTTP
    or

    HTTPS URL in the command line, indicating a remote file download attempt. This
    detection

    leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
    process

    execution logs that include command-line details. This activity is significant
    as

    it may indicate an attempt to download and execute potentially malicious software

    from a remote server. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
    code
