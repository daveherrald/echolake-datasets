  description: The following analytic detects the use of the 'make' command with elevated
    privileges to execute system commands as root, potentially leading to a root shell.
    It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
    on command-line executions that include 'make', '--eval', and 'sudo'. This activity
    is significant because it indicates a possible privilege escalation attempt, allowing
    a user to gain root access. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could achieve
    full control ov
