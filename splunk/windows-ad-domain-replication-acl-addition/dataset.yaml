  description: The following analytic detects the addition of permissions required
    for a DCSync attack, specifically DS-Replication-Get-Changes, DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All,
    and DS-Replication-Get-Changes-In-Filtered-Set. It leverages EventCode 5136 from
    the Windows Security Event Log to identify when these permissions are granted.
    This activity is significant because it indicates potential preparation for a
    DCSync attack, which can be used to replicate AD objects and exfiltrate sensitive
    data. If confirmed
