  version: 7.0.0
  description: The following analytic detects excessive file deletion events in the
    Windows Defender folder. It leverages Sysmon EventCodes 23 and 26 to identify
    processes deleting multiple files within this directory. This behavior is significant
    as it may indicate an attempt to corrupt or disable Windows Defender, a key security
    component. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to disable
    endpoint protection, facilitating further malicious actions without detection.
