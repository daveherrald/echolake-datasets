  description: The following analytic detects the use of the .NET compiler csc.exe
    for on-the-fly compilation of potentially malicious .NET code. It leverages data
    from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific command-line
    patterns associated with csc.exe. This activity is significant because adversaries
    and malware often use this technique to evade detection by compiling malicious
    code at runtime. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute
    arbitrary code, potential
