  description: The following analytic detects instances of Winlogon.exe, a critical
    Windows process, connecting to public IP addresses. This behavior is identified
    using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on network connections
    made by Winlogon.exe. Under normal circumstances, Winlogon.exe should not connect
    to public IPs, and such activity may indicate a compromise, such as the BlackLotus
    bootkit attack. This detection is significant as it highlights potential system
    integrity breaches.
