  description: The following analytic identifies when a malicious file is detected
    within the Microsoft Office 365 ecosystem through the Advanced Threat Protection
    engine. Attackers may stage and execute malicious files from within the Microsoft
    Office 365 ecosystem. Any detections from built-in Office 365 capabilities should
    be monitored and responded to appropriately. Certain premium Office 365 capabilities
    such as Safe Attachment and Safe Links further enhance these detection and response
    functions.
