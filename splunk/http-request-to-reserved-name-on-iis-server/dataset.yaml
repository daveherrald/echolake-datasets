  description: Detects attempts to exploit a request smuggling technique against IIS
    that leverages a Windows quirk where requests for reserved Windows device names
    such as "/con" trigger an early server response before the request body is received.
    When combined with a Content-Length desynchronization, this behavior can lead
    to a parsing confusion between frontend and backend.
