  description: The following analytic detects the (re)initialization of the Linux
    audit daemon (auditd) by identifying log entries of type DAEMON_START. This event
    indicates that the audit subsystem has resumed logging after being stopped or
    has started during system boot. While DAEMON_START may be expected during reboots
    or legitimate configuration changes, it can also signal attempts to re-enable
    audit logging after evasion, or restarts with modified or reduced rule sets. Monitoring
    this event in correlation
