  description: The following analytic detects multiple CrowdStrike LOW severity alerts,
    indicating a series of minor suspicious activities or policy violations. These
    alerts are not immediately critical but should be reviewed to prevent potential
    threats. They often highlight unusual behavior or low-level risks that, if left
    unchecked, could escalate into more significant security issues. Regular monitoring
    and analysis of these alerts are essential for maintaining robust security.
