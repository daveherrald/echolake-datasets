  description: The following analytic detects instances where vbc.exe, the Visual
    Basic Command Line Compiler, initiates DNS queries. Normally, vbc.exe operates
    locally to compile Visual Basic code and does not require internet access or to
    perform DNS lookups. Therefore, any observed DNS activity originating from vbc.exe
    is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity. This behavior
    often suggests that a malicious payload is masquerading as the legitimate vbc.exe
