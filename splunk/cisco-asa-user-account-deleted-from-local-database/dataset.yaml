  description: 'This analytic detects deletion of user accounts from Cisco ASA devices
    via CLI or ASDM.

    Adversaries may delete local accounts to cover their tracks, remove evidence of
    their activities, disrupt incident response efforts, or deny legitimate administrator
    access during an attack. Account deletion can also indicate an attempt to hide
    the creation of temporary accounts used during compromise.

    The detection monitors for ASA message ID 502102, which is generated whenever
    a local user account is delete'
