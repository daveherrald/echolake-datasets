  description: The following analytic identifies potential Kerberos ticket forging
    attacks, specifically the Diamond Ticket attack. This is detected when a user
    logs into a host and the GroupMembership field in event 4627 indicates a privileged
    group (e.g., Domain Admins), but the user does not actually belong to that group

    field from the event ag
