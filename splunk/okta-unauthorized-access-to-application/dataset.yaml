  description: 'The following analytic identifies attempts by users to access Okta
    applications that have not been assigned to them. It leverages Okta Identity Management
    logs, specifically focusing on failed access attempts to unassigned applications.
    This activity is significant for a SOC as it may indicate potential unauthorized
    access attempts, which could lead to exposure of sensitive information or disruption
    of services. If confirmed malicious, such activity could result in data breaches,
    non-compliance '
