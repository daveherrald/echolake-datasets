  description: The following analytic detects the modification of the Windows Registry
    key "PONT_STRING" under Outlook Options. This disables certain dialog popups,
    which could allow malicious scripts to run without notice. This detection leverages
    data from the Endpoint.Registry datamodel to search for this key changing from
    an unusual process. This activity is significant as it is commonly associated
    with some malware infections, indicating potential malicious intent to harvest
    email information.
