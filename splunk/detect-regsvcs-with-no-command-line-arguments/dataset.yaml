  description: The following analytic detects instances of regsvcs.exe running without
    command line arguments. This behavior typically indicates process injection, where
    another process manipulates regsvcs.exe. The detection leverages data from Endpoint
    Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, IDs, and command-line
    executions. This activity is significant as it may signal an attempt to evade
    detection and execute malicious code. If confirmed malicious, the attacker could
