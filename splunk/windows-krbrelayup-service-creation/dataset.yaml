  description: The following analytic detects the creation of a service with the default
    name "KrbSCM" associated with the KrbRelayUp tool. It leverages Windows System
    Event Logs, specifically EventCode 7045, to identify this activity. This behavior
    is significant as KrbRelayUp is a known tool used for privilege escalation attacks.
    If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to escalate privileges,
    potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.
