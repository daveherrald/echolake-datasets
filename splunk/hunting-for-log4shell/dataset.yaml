  description: The following analytic detects potential exploitation attempts of the
    Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) by analyzing HTTP headers for specific
    patterns. It leverages the Web Datamodel and evaluates various indicators such
    as the presence of `{jndi:`, environment variables, and common URI paths. This
    detection is significant as Log4Shell allows remote code execution, posing a severe
    threat to systems. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain unauthorized access,
    execute arbitrary code,
