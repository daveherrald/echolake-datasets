  description: The following analytic detects the deletion of CloudWatch log groups
    in AWS, identified through `DeleteLogGroup` events in CloudTrail logs. This detection
    leverages CloudTrail data to monitor for successful log group deletions, excluding
    console-based actions. This activity is significant as it indicates potential
    attempts to evade logging and monitoring, which is crucial for maintaining visibility
    into AWS activities. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to hide
    their tracks, maki
