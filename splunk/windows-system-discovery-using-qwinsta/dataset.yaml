  description: The following analytic detects the execution of "qwinsta.exe" on a
    Windows operating system. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection
    and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs. The "qwinsta.exe"
    tool is significant because it can display detailed session information on a remote
    desktop session host server. This behavior is noteworthy as it is commonly abused
    by Qakbot malware to gather system information and send it back to its Command
    and Control (C2) server. If
