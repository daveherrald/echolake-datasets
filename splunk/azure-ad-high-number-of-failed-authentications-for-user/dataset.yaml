  description: The following analytic identifies an Azure AD account experiencing
    more than 20 failed authentication attempts within a 10-minute window. This detection
    leverages Azure SignInLogs data, specifically monitoring for error code 50126
    and unsuccessful authentication attempts. This behavior is significant as it may
    indicate a brute force attack targeting the account. If confirmed malicious, an
    attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access, leading to data breaches
    or further exploitation within
