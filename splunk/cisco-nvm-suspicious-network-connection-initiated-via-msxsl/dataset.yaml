  description: 'This analytic identifies the use of `msxsl.exe` initiating a network
    connection to a non-private IP address.

    Although `msxsl.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft utility used to apply XSLT transformations,
    adversaries can abuse it

    to execute arbitrary code or load external resources in an evasive manner.

    This detection leverages Cisco NVM telemetry to identify potentially malicious
    use of `msxsl.exe` making network connections

    that may indicate command and control (C2) or data exfiltration activity.
