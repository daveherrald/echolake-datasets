  description: The following analytic detects the execution of rundll32.exe with command-line
    arguments loading davclnt.dll and the davsetcookie function to access a remote
    WebDav instance. It uses data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
    correlating process execution and network traffic data. This activity is significant
    as it may indicate exploitation of CVE-2023-23397, a known vulnerability. If confirmed
    malicious, this could allow an attacker to establish unauthorized remote connections,
