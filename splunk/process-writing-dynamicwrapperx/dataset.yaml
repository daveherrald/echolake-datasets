  description: The following analytic detects a process writing the dynwrapx.dll file
    to disk and registering it in the registry. It leverages data from the Endpoint
    datamodel, specifically monitoring process and filesystem events. This activity
    is significant because DynamicWrapperX is an ActiveX component often used in scripts
    to call Windows API functions, and its presence in non-standard locations is highly
    suspicious. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
    code, escalate
