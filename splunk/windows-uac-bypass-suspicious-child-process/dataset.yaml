  description: The following analytic detects when an executable known for User Account
    Control (UAC) bypass exploitation spawns a child process in a user-controlled
    location or a command shell executable (e.g., cmd.exe, powershell.exe). This detection
    leverages Sysmon EventID 1 data, focusing on high or system integrity level processes
    with specific parent-child process relationships. This activity is significant
    as it may indicate an attacker has successfully used a UAC bypass exploit to escalate
    privileges.
