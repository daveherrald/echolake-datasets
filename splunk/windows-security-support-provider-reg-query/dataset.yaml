  description: The following analytic identifies command-line activity querying the
    registry for Security Support Providers (SSPs) related to Local Security Authority
    (LSA) protection and configuration. This detection leverages Endpoint Detection
    and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on processes accessing specific LSA registry
    paths. Monitoring this activity is crucial as adversaries and post-exploitation
    tools like winpeas may use it to gather information on LSA protections, potentially
    leading to credentia
