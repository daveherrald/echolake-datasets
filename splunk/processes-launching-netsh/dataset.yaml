  description: The following analytic identifies processes launching netsh.exe, a
    command-line utility used to modify network configurations. It detects this activity
    by analyzing data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
    on process GUIDs, names, parent processes, and command-line executions. This behavior
    is significant because netsh.exe can be exploited to execute malicious helper
    DLLs, serving as a persistence mechanism. If confirmed malicious, an attacker
    could gain persistent access
