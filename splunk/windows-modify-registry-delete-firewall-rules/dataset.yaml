  description: The following analytic detects a potential deletion of firewall rules,
    indicating a possible security breach or unauthorized access attempt. It identifies
    actions where firewall rules are removed using commands like netsh advfirewall
    firewall delete rule, which can expose the network to external threats by disabling
    critical security measures. Monitoring these activities helps maintain network
    integrity and prevent malicious attacks.
