  description: The following analytic identifies the execution of `powershell.exe`
    with command-line arguments used to query domain groups via the `Get-WmiObject`
    cmdlet and the `-class ds_group` parameter. This detection leverages data from
    Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line
    executions. This activity is significant as it indicates potential reconnaissance
    efforts by adversaries to enumerate domain groups, which is a common step in Active
    Directory Discover
