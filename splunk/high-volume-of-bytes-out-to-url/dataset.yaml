  description: The following analytic detects a high volume of outbound web traffic,
    specifically over 1GB of data sent to a URL within a 2-minute window. It leverages
    the Web data model to identify significant uploads by analyzing the sum of bytes
    out. This activity is significant as it may indicate potential data exfiltration
    by malware or malicious insiders. If confirmed as malicious, this behavior could
    lead to unauthorized data transfer, resulting in data breaches and loss of sensitive
    information. Immedi
