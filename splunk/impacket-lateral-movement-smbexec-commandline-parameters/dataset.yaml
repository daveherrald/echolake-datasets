  description: The following analytic identifies suspicious command-line parameters
    associated with the use of Impacket's smbexec.py for lateral movement. It leverages
    data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific command-line
    patterns indicative of Impacket tool usage. This activity is significant as both
    Red Teams and adversaries use Impacket for remote code execution and lateral movement.
