  description: The following analytic detects the deletion of SSH keys on a Linux
    machine. It leverages filesystem event logs to identify when files within "/etc/ssh/*"
    or "~/.ssh/*" are deleted. This activity is significant because attackers may
    delete or modify SSH keys to evade security measures or as part of a destructive
    payload, similar to the AcidRain malware. If confirmed malicious, this behavior
    could lead to impaired security features, hindered forensic investigations, or
    further unauthorized access,
