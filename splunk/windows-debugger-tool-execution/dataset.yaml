  description: This analysis detects the use of debugger tools within a production
    environment. While these tools are legitimate for file analysis and debugging,
    they are abused by malware like PlugX and DarkGate for malicious DLL side-loading.
    The hunting query aids Security Operations Centers (SOCs) in identifying potentially
    suspicious tool executions, particularly for non-technical users in the production
    network.
