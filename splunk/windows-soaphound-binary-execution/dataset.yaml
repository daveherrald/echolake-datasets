  description: 'The following analytic detects the execution of the SOAPHound binary
    (`soaphound.exe`) with specific command-line arguments. It leverages data from
    Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, command-line
    arguments, and other process-related metadata. This activity is significant because
    SOAPHound is a known tool used for credential dumping and other malicious activities.
    If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to extract sensitive
    information, '
