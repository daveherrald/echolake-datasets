  description: The following analytic detects attempts to escalate privileges on a
    Linux system using Docker. It identifies processes where Docker commands are used
    to mount the root directory or execute shell commands within a container. This
    detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing
    on process names, command-line arguments, and parent processes. This activity
    is significant because it can allow an attacker with Docker privileges to modify
    critical system files, such as /et
