  description: 'The following analytic detects instances where the Chromium-based
    browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge) is launched with the --user-data-dir
    command-line argument. While this flag is legitimate and used for multi-profile
    support or automation, it is frequently leveraged by malware and adversaries to
    run Chrome in an isolated environment for stealth operations, credential harvesting,
    phishing delivery, or evasion of user session artifacts.
