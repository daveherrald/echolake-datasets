  description: The following analytic detects winhlp32.exe spawning a child process
    that loads a file from appdata, programdata, or temp directories. This detection
    leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
    process creation events. This activity is significant because winhlp32.exe has
    known vulnerabilities and can be exploited to execute malicious code. If confirmed
    malicious, an attacker could use this technique to execute arbitrary scripts,
    escalate privileges, or maintain
