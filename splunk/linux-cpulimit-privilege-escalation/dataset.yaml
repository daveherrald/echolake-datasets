  description: The following analytic detects the use of the 'cpulimit' command with
    specific flags ('-l', '-f') executed with 'sudo' privileges. It leverages data
    from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process command-line
    arguments and execution details. This activity is significant because if 'cpulimit'
    is granted sudo rights, a user can potentially execute system commands as root,
    leading to privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker
    to gain root acce
