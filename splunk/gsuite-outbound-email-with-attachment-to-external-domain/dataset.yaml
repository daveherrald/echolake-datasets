  description: The following analytic detects outbound emails with attachments sent
    from an internal email domain to an external domain. It leverages Gsuite Gmail
    logs, parsing the source and destination email domains, and flags emails with
    fewer than 20 outbound instances. This activity is significant as it may indicate
    potential data exfiltration or insider threats. If confirmed malicious, an attacker
    could use this method to exfiltrate sensitive information, leading to data breaches
    and compliance violation
