  description: 'This analytic detects execution of packet capture commands on Cisco
    ASA devices via CLI or ASDM.

    Adversaries may abuse the built-in packet capture functionality to perform network
    sniffing, intercept credentials transmitted over the network, capture sensitive
    data in transit, or gather intelligence about network traffic patterns and internal
    communications. Packet captures can reveal usernames, passwords, session tokens,
    and confidential business data.

    The detection monitors for command executio'
