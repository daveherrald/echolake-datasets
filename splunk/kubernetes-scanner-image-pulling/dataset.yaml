  description: 'The following analytic detects the pulling of known Kubernetes security
    scanner images such as kube-hunter, kube-bench, and kube-recon. It leverages Kubernetes
    logs ingested through Splunk Connect for Kubernetes, specifically monitoring for
    messages indicating the pulling of these images. This activity is significant
    because the use of security scanners can indicate an attempt to identify vulnerabilities
    within the Kubernetes environment. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to
