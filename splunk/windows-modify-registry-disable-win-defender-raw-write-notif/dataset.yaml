  description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
    that disable the Windows Defender raw write notification feature. It leverages
    data from the Endpoint.Registry datamodel, specifically monitoring changes to
    the registry path associated with Windows Defender's real-time protection settings.
    This activity is significant because disabling raw write notifications can allow
    malware, such as Azorult, to bypass Windows Defender's behavior monitoring, potentially
    leading to undetected
