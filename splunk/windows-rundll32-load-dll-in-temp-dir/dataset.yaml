  description: This detection identifies instances where rundll32.exe is used to load
    a DLL from a temporary directory, such as C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\Temp\
    or C:\Windows\Temp\. While rundll32.exe is a legitimate Windows utility used to
    execute functions exported from DLLs, its use to load libraries from temporary
    locations is highly suspicious. These directories are commonly used by malware
    and red team tools to stage payloads or execute code in-memory without writing
    it to more persistent locations. T
