  description: The following analytic detects attempts to read LSASS memory, indicative
    of credential dumping. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 10, filtering for specific
    access permissions (0x1010 and 0x1410) on the lsass.exe process. This activity
    is significant because it suggests an attacker is trying to extract credentials
    from LSASS memory, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches,
    and compromise of sensitive information. If confirmed malicious, this could enable
    attackers to escalate privi
