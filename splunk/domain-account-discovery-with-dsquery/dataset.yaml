  description: The following analytic identifies the execution of `dsquery.exe` with
    command-line arguments used to discover domain users. It leverages data from Endpoint
    Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line
    executions. This activity is significant as it indicates potential reconnaissance
    efforts by adversaries to map out domain users, which is a common precursor to
    further attacks. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to
    gain insights into user
