  description: The following analytic detects any system integrity level process spawned
    by a non-system account. It leverages Sysmon EventID 1, focusing on process integrity
    and parent user data. This behavior is significant as it often indicates successful
    privilege escalation to SYSTEM from a user-controlled process or service. If confirmed
    malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to gain full control over the
    system, execute arbitrary code, and potentially compromise the entire environment.
