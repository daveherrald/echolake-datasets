  description: The following analytic identifies system information discovery techniques,
    such as the execution of commands like `wmic qfe`, `systeminfo`, and `hostname`.
    It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
    on process execution logs. This activity is significant because attackers often
    use these commands to gather system configuration details, which can aid in further
    exploitation. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to tailor
    their attacks base
