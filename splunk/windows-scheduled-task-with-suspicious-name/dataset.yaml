  description: 'The following analytic detects the creation, modification, or enabling
    of scheduled tasks with known suspicious or malicious task names. It leverages
    Windows Security EventCode 4698, 4700, and 4702 to identify when such tasks are
    registered, modified, or enabled. This activity is significant as it may indicate
    an attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious commands on a system.
    If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to maintain access, execute
    arbitrary code, or escalate '
