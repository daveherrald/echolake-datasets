  description: The following analytic detects the shutdown of the Windows Event Log
    service by leveraging Windows Event ID 1100. This event is logged every time the
    service stops, including during normal system shutdowns. Monitoring this activity
    is crucial as it can indicate attempts to cover tracks or disable logging. If
    confirmed malicious, an attacker could hide their activities, making it difficult
    to trace their actions and investigate further incidents. Analysts should verify
    if the shutdown was planned
