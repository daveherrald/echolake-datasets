  version: 11.0.0
  description: The following analytic detects instances of DLLHost.exe executing without
    command line arguments. This behavior is unusual and often associated with malicious
    activities, such as those performed by Cobalt Strike. The detection leverages
    data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution
    logs. This activity is significant because DLLHost.exe typically requires arguments
    to function correctly, and its absence may indicate an attempt to evade detection.
