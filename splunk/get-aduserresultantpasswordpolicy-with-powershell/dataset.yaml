  description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` running
    the `Get-ADUserResultantPasswordPolicy` cmdlet, which is used to obtain the password
    policy in a Windows domain. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
    (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity
