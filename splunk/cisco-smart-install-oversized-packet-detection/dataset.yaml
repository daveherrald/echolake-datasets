  description: 'This analytic detects oversized Cisco Smart Install (SMI) protocol
    messages by inspecting traffic to TCP port 4786

    within the Network_Traffic data model. Abnormally large SMI payloads have been
    associated with exploitation and

    protocol abuse (e.g., CVE-2018-0171; activity reported by the "Static Tundra"
    threat actor). Monitoring message

    sizes over time can help identify possible attempts at remote code execution,
    denial of service, or reconnaissance

    against Cisco devices exposing Smart Install.
