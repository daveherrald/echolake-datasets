  description: The following analytic detects the usage of `rclone.exe` with specific
    command-line arguments indicative of file transfer activities. It leverages data
    from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions
    and process details. This activity is significant as `rclone.exe` is often used
    by adversaries for data exfiltration, especially during ransomware attacks. If
    confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to unauthorized data transfer, resulting
    in data breache
