  description: 'This analytic identifies non-browser processes reaching out to public
    IP lookup or geolocation services,

    such as `ipinfo.io`, `icanhazip.com`, `ip-api.com`, and others.

    These domains are commonly used by legitimate tools, but their usage outside of
    browsers may indicate

    network reconnaissance, virtual machine detection, or staging by malware.

    This activity is observed in post-exploitation frameworks, stealer malware, and
    advanced threat actor campaigns.

    The detection relies on Cisco Network Visi'
