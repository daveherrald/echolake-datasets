  description: The following analytic detects the modification of the registry to
    disable Windows Defender's Enhanced Notification feature. It leverages data from
    Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, specifically monitoring changes
    to the registry path associated with Windows Defender reporting. This activity
    is significant because disabling Enhanced Notifications can prevent users and
    administrators from receiving critical security alerts, potentially allowing malicious
    activities to go unnoticed. If
