  description: 'The following analytic detects the addition of new credentials for
    Service Principals within an Office 365 tenant. It uses O365 audit logs, focusing
    on events related to credential modifications or additions in the AzureActiveDirectory
    workload. This activity is significant because Service Principals represent application
    identities, and their credentials allow applications to authenticate and access
    resources. If an attacker successfully adds or modifies these credentials, they
    can impersonate '
