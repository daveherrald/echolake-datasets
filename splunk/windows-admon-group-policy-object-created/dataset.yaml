  description: The following analytic detects the creation of a new Group Policy Object
    (GPO) using Splunk's Admon data. It identifies events where a new GPO is created,
    excluding default "New Group Policy Object" entries. Monitoring GPO creation is
    crucial as adversaries can exploit GPOs to escalate privileges or deploy malware
    across an Active Directory network. If confirmed malicious, this activity could
    allow attackers to control system configurations, deploy ransomware, or propagate
    malware, significantly
