  description: This detection identifies potential exploitation of CVE-2025-24813
    in Apache Tomcat through the second stage of the attack. This phase occurs when
    an attacker attempts to trigger deserialization of a previously uploaded malicious
    session file by sending a GET request with a specially crafted JSESSIONID cookie.
    These requests typically have specific characteristics, including a JSESSIONID
    cookie with a leading dot that matches a previously uploaded filename, and typically
    result in a HTTP 500 err
