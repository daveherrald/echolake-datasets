  description: The following analytic identifies an unusual number of Kerberos service
    ticket requests, potentially indicating a kerberoasting attack. It leverages Kerberos
    Event 4769 and calculates the standard deviation for each host, using the 3-sigma
    rule to detect anomalies. This activity is significant as kerberoasting allows
    adversaries to request service tickets and crack them offline, potentially gaining
    privileged access to the domain. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
    access to
