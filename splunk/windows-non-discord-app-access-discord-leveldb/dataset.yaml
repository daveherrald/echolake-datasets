  description: The following analytic detects non-Discord applications accessing the
    Discord LevelDB database. It leverages Windows Security Event logs, specifically
    event code 4663, to identify file access attempts to the LevelDB directory by
    processes other than Discord. This activity is significant as it may indicate
    attempts to steal Discord credentials or access sensitive user data. If confirmed

    and other critical information, p
