  description: 'The following analytic detects the addition of a new custom domain
    within an Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant. It leverages Azure AD AuditLogs
    to identify successful "Add unverified domain" operations. This activity is significant
    as it may indicate an adversary attempting to establish persistence by setting
    up identity federation backdoors, allowing them to impersonate users and bypass
    authentication mechanisms. If confirmed malicious, this could enable attackers
    to gain unauthorized access, '
