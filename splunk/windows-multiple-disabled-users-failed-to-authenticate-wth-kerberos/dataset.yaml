  description: The following analytic detects a single source endpoint failing to
    authenticate with 30 unique disabled domain users using the Kerberos protocol
    within 5 minutes. It leverages Windows Security Event 4768, focusing on failure
    code `0x12`, indicating revoked credentials. This activity is significant as it
    may indicate a Password Spraying attack targeting disabled accounts, a tactic
    used by adversaries to gain initial access or elevate privileges. If confirmed
    malicious, this could lead to unauthor
