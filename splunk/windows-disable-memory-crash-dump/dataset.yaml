  description: The following analytic detects attempts to disable the memory crash
    dump feature on Windows systems by setting the registry value to 0. It leverages
    data from the Endpoint.Registry datamodel, specifically monitoring changes to
    the CrashDumpEnabled registry key. This activity is significant because disabling
    crash dumps can hinder forensic analysis and incident response efforts. If confirmed
    malicious, this action could be part of a broader attack strategy, such as data
    destruction or system dest
