  description: The following analytic detects the creation of AWS Network Access Control
    Lists (ACLs) with all ports open to a specified CIDR. It leverages AWS CloudTrail
    events, specifically monitoring for `CreateNetworkAclEntry` or `ReplaceNetworkAclEntry`
    actions with rules allowing all traffic. This activity is significant because
    it can expose the network to unauthorized access, increasing the risk of data
    breaches and other malicious activities. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could
    exploit this misc
