  version: 6.0.0
  description: The following analytic detects when an IIS Module DLL fails to load
    due to a configuration problem, identified by EventCode 2282. This detection leverages
    Windows Application event logs to identify repeated failures in loading IIS modules.
    Such failures can indicate misconfigurations or potential tampering with IIS components.
    If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to service disruptions or provide
    an attacker with opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities within the IIS environment.
