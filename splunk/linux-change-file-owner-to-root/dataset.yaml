  description: 'The following analytic detects the use of the ''chown'' command to
    change a file owner to ''root'' on a Linux system. It leverages Endpoint Detection
    and Response (EDR) telemetry, specifically monitoring command-line executions
    and process details. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt

    control over the compromised '
