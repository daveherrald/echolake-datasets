  description: The following analytic detects suspicious Base64 decode operations
    that may indicate malicious activity, such as data exfiltration or execution of
    encoded commands. Base64 is commonly used to encode data for safe transmission,
    but attackers may abuse it to conceal malicious payloads. This detection focuses
    on identifying unusual or unexpected Base64 decoding processes, particularly when
    associated with critical files or directories. By monitoring these activities,
    the analytic helps uncover pote
