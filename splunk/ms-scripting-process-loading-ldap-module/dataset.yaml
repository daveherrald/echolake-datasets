  description: The following analytic detects the execution of MS scripting processes
    (wscript.exe or cscript.exe) loading LDAP-related modules (Wldap32.dll, adsldp.dll,
    adsldpc.dll). It leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to identify these specific DLL loads.

    information, a behavior observed in FIN7 implants. If confirmed malicious, this
    could allow attackers to gather detailed Active Directory information, potentially
    leading to furth
