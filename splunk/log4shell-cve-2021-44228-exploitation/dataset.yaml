  description: The following analytic identifies potential exploitation of Log4Shell
    CVE-2021-44228 by correlating multiple MITRE ATT&CK tactics detected in risk events.
    It leverages Splunk's risk data model to calculate the distinct count of MITRE
    ATT&CK tactics from Log4Shell-related detections. This activity is significant
    because it indicates a high probability of exploitation if two or more distinct
    tactics are observed. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to initial
    payload delivery, callbac
