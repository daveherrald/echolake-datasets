# Log4Shell CVE-2021-44228 Exploitation

**Type:** Correlation

**Author:** Jose Hernandez, Splunk

## Description

The following analytic identifies potential exploitation of Log4Shell CVE-2021-44228 by correlating multiple MITRE ATT&CK tactics detected in risk events. It leverages Splunk's risk data model to calculate the distinct count of MITRE ATT&CK tactics from Log4Shell-related detections. This activity is significant because it indicates a high probability of exploitation if two or more distinct tactics are observed. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to initial payload delivery, callback to a malicious server, and post-exploitation activities, potentially resulting in unauthorized access, lateral movement, and further compromise of the affected systems.
