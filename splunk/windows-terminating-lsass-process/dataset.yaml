  description: 'The following analytic detects a suspicious process attempting to
    terminate the Lsass.exe process. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 10 logs to identify
    processes granted PROCESS_TERMINATE access to Lsass.exe. This activity is significant
    because Lsass.exe is a critical process responsible for enforcing security policies
    and handling user credentials. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could indicate
    an attempt to perform credential dumping, privilege escalation, or evasion of
    security policies, '
