  description: The following analytic detects the execution of curl commands with
    insecure flags within the Cisco Isovalent environment. It identifies this activity
    by monitoring process execution logs for curl commands that use the -k or --insecure
    flags. This behavior is significant for a SOC as it could allow an attacker to
    bypass SSL/TLS verification, potentially exposing the Kubernetes infrastructure
    to man-in-the-middle attacks. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead
    to data interception, servi
