  description: 'The following analytic detects the execution of suspicious bash commands
    commonly used in scripts like AutoSUID, LinEnum, and LinPeas for system discovery
    on a Linux host. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, specifically
    looking for a high number of distinct commands executed within a short time frame.

    malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain detailed system
    information, '
