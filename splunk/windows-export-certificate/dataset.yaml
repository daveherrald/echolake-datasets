  description: The following analytic detects the export of a certificate from the
    Windows Certificate Store. It leverages the Certificates Lifecycle log channel,
    specifically event ID 1007, to identify this activity. Monitoring certificate
    exports is crucial as certificates can be used for authentication to VPNs or private
    resources. If malicious actors export certificates, they could potentially gain
    unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data, leading to significant security
    breaches.
