  description: The following analytic detects the creation of an .exe file along with
    its corresponding .exe.config and a .dll in the same directory, which is a common
    pattern indicative of potential AppDomain hijacking or CLR code injection attempts.
    This behavior may signal that a malicious actor is attempting to load a rogue
    assembly into a legitimate application's AppDomain, allowing code execution under
    the context of a trusted process.
