  description: 'This analytic detects system binaries that are commonly abused in
    process injection techniques but are observed without any command-line arguments.

    It leverages Cisco Network Visibility Module (NVM) flow data and process arguments

    to identify outbound connections initiated by curl where TLS checks were explicitly
    disabled.

    Binaries such as `rundll32.exe`, `regsvr32.exe`, `dllhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`,
    and others are legitimate Windows processes that are often injected into by malware
    or post-expl'
