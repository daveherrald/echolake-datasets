  description: 'The following analytic detects a PowerShell script that enumerates
    camera devices on the targeted host. This detection leverages PowerShell Script
    Block Logging, specifically looking for commands querying Win32_PnPEntity for
    camera-related information. This activity is significant as it is commonly observed
    in DCRat malware, which collects camera data to send to its command-and-control
    server. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could indicate an attempt to gather
    sensitive visual information '
