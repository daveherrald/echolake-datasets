  description: 'Adversaries may intentionally suppress or reduce the volume of core
    Cisco ASA syslog messages to evade detection or cover their tracks. This hunting
    search is recommended to proactively identify suspicious downward shifts or absences
    in key syslog message IDs, which may indicate tampering or malicious activity.
    Visualizing this data in Splunk dashboards enables security teams to quickly spot
    anomalies and investigate potential compromise.
