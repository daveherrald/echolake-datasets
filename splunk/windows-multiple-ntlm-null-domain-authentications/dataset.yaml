  description: The following analytic detects when a device is the target of numerous
    NTLM authentications using a null domain. This activity generally results when
    an attacker attempts to brute force, password spray, or otherwise authenticate
    to a domain joined Windows device from a non-domain device. This activity may
    also generate a large number of EventID 4776 events in tandem, however these events
    will not indicate the attacker or target device
