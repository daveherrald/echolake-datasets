  description: The following analytic detects changes to the sIDHistory attribute
    of user or computer objects within the same domain. It leverages Windows Security
    Event Codes 4738 and 4742 to identify when the sIDHistory attribute is modified.
    This activity is significant because the sIDHistory attribute can be abused by
    adversaries to grant unauthorized access by inheriting permissions from another
    account. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to maintain persistent
    access or escalate privilege
