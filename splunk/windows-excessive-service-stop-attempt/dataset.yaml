  description: 'The following analytic detects multiple attempts to stop or delete
    services on a system using `net.exe` or `sc.exe`. It leverages Endpoint Detection
    and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process names and command-line executions
    within a one-minute window. This activity is significant as it may indicate an
    adversary attempting to disable security or critical services to evade detection
    and further their objectives. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to the attacker
    gaining persistence, '
