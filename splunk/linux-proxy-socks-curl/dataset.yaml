  description: The following analytic detects the use of the `curl` command with proxy-related
    arguments such as `-x`, `socks`, `--preproxy`, and `--proxy`. This detection leverages
    data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line
    executions and process details. This activity is significant as it may indicate
    an adversary attempting to use a proxy to evade network monitoring and obscure
    their actions. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to
    bypass security
