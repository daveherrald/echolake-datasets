  description: The following analytic detects processes loading the samlib.dll or
    samcli.dll modules, which are often abused to access Security Account Manager
    (SAM) objects or credentials on domain controllers. This detection leverages Sysmon
    EventCode 7 to identify these DLLs being loaded outside typical system directories.
    Monitoring this activity is crucial as it may indicate attempts to gather sensitive
    identity information. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers
    to obtain credentials
