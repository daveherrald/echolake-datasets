  description: 'The following analytic detects the execution of the Microsoft Software
    Licensing User Interface Tool (`slui.exe`) with elevated privileges using the
    `-verb runas` function. This activity is identified through logs from Endpoint
    Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific registry keys and command-line
    parameters. This behavior is significant as it indicates a potential privilege
    escalation attempt, which could allow an attacker to gain elevated access and
    execute malicious actions '
