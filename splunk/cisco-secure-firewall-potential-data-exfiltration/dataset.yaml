  description: The following analytic detects potentially suspicious large outbound
    data transfers from internal to external networks. It leverages Cisco Secure Firewall
    Threat Defense logs and calculates the total volume of data exchanged per connection
    by summing InitiatorBytes and ResponderBytes. Connections exceeding 100 MB are
    flagged, as these may indicate unauthorized data exfiltration, especially if initiated
    by unusual users, hosts, or processes. This analytic is scoped to inside-to-outside
    flows usin
