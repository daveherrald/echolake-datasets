  description: This analytic detects potential container escape or reconnaissance
    attempts by monitoring for the rapid execution of multiple suspicious Linux commands
    (nsenter, mount, ps aux, and ls) within a short time window. The search aggregates
    process execution logs into 5-minute buckets and identifies when two or more distinct
    commands occur in quick succession. This behavior is noteworthy because attackers
    often chain these commands together to pivot from a container into the host, enumerate
    processes,
