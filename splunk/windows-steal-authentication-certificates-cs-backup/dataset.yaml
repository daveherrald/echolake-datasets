  description: The following analytic identifies the backup of the Active Directory
    Certificate Services (AD CS) store, detected via Event ID 4876. This event is
    logged when a backup is performed using the CertSrv.msc UI or the CertUtil.exe
    -BackupDB command. Monitoring this activity is crucial as unauthorized backups
    can indicate an attempt to steal authentication certificates, which are critical
    for secure communications. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an
    attacker to impersonate users, esc
