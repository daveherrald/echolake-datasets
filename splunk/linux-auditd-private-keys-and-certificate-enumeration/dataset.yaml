  description: The following analytic detects suspicious attempts to find private
    keys, which may indicate an attacker's effort to access sensitive cryptographic
    information. Private keys are crucial for securing encrypted communications and
    data, and unauthorized access to them can lead to severe security breaches, including
    data decryption and identity theft. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized
    searches for private keys, this analytic helps identify potential threats to cryptographic
    security, enabling
