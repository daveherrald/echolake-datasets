  description: This analytic detects access attempts to the PowerShell Web Access
    (PSWA) console on Windows IIS servers. It monitors web traffic for requests to
    PSWA-related URIs, which could indicate legitimate administrative activity or
    potential unauthorized access attempts. By tracking source IP, HTTP status, URI
    path, and HTTP method, it helps identify suspicious patterns or brute-force attacks
    targeting PSWA. This detection is crucial for maintaining the security of remote
    PowerShell management interface
