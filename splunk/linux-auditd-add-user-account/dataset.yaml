  description: The following analytic detects the creation of new user accounts on
    Linux systems using commands like "useradd" or "adduser." It leverages data from
    Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line
    executions. This activity is significant as adversaries often create new user
    accounts to establish persistence on compromised hosts. If confirmed malicious,
    this could allow attackers to maintain access, escalate privileges, and further
    compromise the system, p
