  description: The following analytic identifies the use of suspicious command-line
    parameters associated with Impacket tools, such as `wmiexec.py`, `smbexec.py`,
    `dcomexec.py`, and `atexec.py`, which are used for lateral movement and remote
    code execution. It detects these activities by analyzing process execution logs
    from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific command-line
    patterns. This activity is significant because Impacket tools are commonly used
    by adversaries and Red Teams
