  description: "This analytic detects excessive kernel probe (kprobe) events in a\
    \ Kubernetes cluster over a short period of time. \nKprobes are a Linux kernel\
    \ debugging and instrumentation mechanism that allows dynamic monitoring and tracing\
    \ of kernel functions and system calls. \nIn containerized or cloud-native environments,\
    \ kprobes are occasionally used for legitimate low-level diagnostics; however,\
    \ monitoring a spike in kprobe activity is important because malware or attackers\
    \ may abuse this mechanism to gain"
