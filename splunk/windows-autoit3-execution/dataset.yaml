  description: "The following analytic detects the execution of AutoIt3, a scripting\n\
    language often used for automating Windows GUI tasks and general scripting. \n\
    It identifies instances where AutoIt3 or its variants are executed by searching\
    \ for process names\nor original file names matching 'autoit3.exe'. \nThis activity\
    \ is significant because attackers frequently use AutoIt3 to automate malicious\
    \ actions, such as executing malware. \nIf confirmed malicious, this activity\
    \ could lead to unauthorized code execution"
