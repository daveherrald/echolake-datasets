  description: "The following analytic detects the process of logging off a user through\
    \ the use of the quser and logoff commands. By monitoring for these commands,\
    \ the analytic identifies actions where a user session is forcibly terminated,\
    \ which could be part of an administrative task or a potentially unauthorized\
    \ access attempt. This detection helps identify potential misuse or malicious\
    \ activity where a user\u2019s access is revoked without proper authorization,\
    \ providing insight into potential security incident"
