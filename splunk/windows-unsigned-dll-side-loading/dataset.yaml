  description: The following analytic detects the creation of potentially malicious
    unsigned DLLs in the c:\windows\system32 or c:\windows\syswow64 folders. It leverages
    Sysmon EventCode 7 logs to identify unsigned DLLs with unavailable signatures
    loaded in these critical directories. This activity is significant as it may indicate
    a DLL hijacking attempt, a technique used by attackers to gain unauthorized access
    and execute malicious code. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to privilege
    escalation, allow
