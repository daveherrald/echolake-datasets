  description: The following analytic detects when the Kerberos Pre-Authentication
    flag is disabled in a user account, using Windows Security Event 4738. This event
    indicates a change in the UserAccountControl property of a domain user object.
    Disabling this flag allows adversaries to perform offline brute force attacks
    on the user's password using the AS-REP Roasting technique. This activity is significant
    as it can be used by attackers with existing privileges to escalate their access
    or maintain persistence
