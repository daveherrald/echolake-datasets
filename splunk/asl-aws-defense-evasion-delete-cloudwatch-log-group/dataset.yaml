  description: 'The following analytic detects the deletion of CloudWatch log groups
    in AWS, identified through `DeleteLogGroup` events in CloudTrail logs. This method
    leverages Amazon Security Lake logs parsed in the OCSF format. The activity is
    significant because attackers may delete log groups to evade detection and disrupt
    logging capabilities, hindering incident response efforts. If confirmed malicious,
    this action could allow attackers to cover their tracks, making it difficult to
    trace their activities '
