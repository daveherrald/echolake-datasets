  description: The following analytic detects a high frequency of file deletions in
    the /boot/ folder on Linux systems. It leverages filesystem event logs to identify
    when 200 or more files are deleted within an hour by the same process. This behavior
    is significant as it may indicate the presence of wiper malware, such as Industroyer2,
    which targets critical system directories. If confirmed malicious, this activity
    could lead to system instability or failure, hindering the boot process and potentially
    causing
