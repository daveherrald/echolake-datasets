  description: The following analytic detects the execution of rundll32.exe with the
    `Control_RunDLL` command, loading files from world-writable directories such as
    windows\temp, programdata, or appdata. This detection leverages Endpoint Detection
    and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process command-line data and specific
    directory paths. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to
    exploit CVE-2021-40444 or similar vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute
    arbitrary code. If confirm
