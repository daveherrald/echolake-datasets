  description: Detects Ollama server errors and failures during model loading operations
    that may indicate malicious model injection, path traversal attempts, or exploitation
    of model loading mechanisms to achieve remote code execution. Adversaries may
    attempt to load specially crafted malicious models or exploit vulnerabilities
    in the model loading process to execute arbitrary code on the server. This detection
    monitors error messages and failure patterns that could signal attempts to abuse
