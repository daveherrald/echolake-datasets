  description: The following analytic detects CrowdStrike alerts for admin accounts
    with duplicate password risk, identifying instances where administrative users
    share the same password. This practice significantly increases the risk of unauthorized
    access and potential breaches. Addressing these alerts promptly is crucial for
    maintaining strong security protocols, ensuring each admin account uses a unique,
    secure password to protect critical systems and data.
