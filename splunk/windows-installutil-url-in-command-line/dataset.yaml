  description: The following analytic detects the use of Windows InstallUtil.exe with
    an HTTP or HTTPS URL in the command line. This is identified through Endpoint
    Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on command-line executions containing
    URLs. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to download and
    execute malicious code, potentially bypassing application control mechanisms.
    If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code execution, privilege
    escalation, or persiste
