  description: The following analytic detects modifications in the Windows registry
    to suppress Windows Defender notifications. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry
    datamodel, specifically targeting changes to the "Notification_Suppress" registry
    value. This activity is significant because adversaries, including those deploying
    Azorult malware, use this technique to bypass Windows Defender and disable critical
    notifications. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to
    evade detection
