# Windows Processes Killed By Industroyer2 Malware

**Type:** Anomaly

**Author:** Teoderick Contreras, Splunk

## Description

The following analytic detects the termination of specific processes by the Industroyer2 malware. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 5 to identify when processes like "PServiceControl.exe" and "PService_PPD.exe" are killed. This activity is significant as it targets processes related to energy facility networks, indicating a potential attack on critical infrastructure. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to disruption of essential services, loss of control over energy systems, and significant operational impact. Immediate investigation is required to determine the cause and mitigate any potential threats.
