  description: The following analytic detects the creation of a Kubernetes NodePort
    service, which exposes a service to the external network. It identifies this activity
    by monitoring Kubernetes Audit logs for the creation of NodePort services. This
    behavior is significant for a SOC as it could allow an attacker to access internal
    services, posing a threat to the Kubernetes infrastructure's integrity and security.
    If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to data breaches, service disruptions,
    or unauth
