  version: 5.0.0
  description: The following analytic detects cloud provisioning activities originating
    from previously unseen regions. It leverages cloud infrastructure logs to identify
    events where resources are started or created, and cross-references these with
    a baseline of known regions. This activity is significant as it may indicate unauthorized
    access or misuse of cloud resources from unfamiliar locations. If confirmed malicious,
    this could lead to unauthorized resource creation, potential data exfiltration,
    or furth
