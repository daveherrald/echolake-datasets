# SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer Exploitation Attempt

**Type:** Hunting

**Author:** Michael Haag, Splunk

## Description

Detects potential exploitation attempts targeting CVE-2025-31324, a critical unauthenticated file upload vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer. This flaw allows remote attackers to send specially crafted POST requests to the /developmentserver/metadatauploader endpoint, enabling arbitrary file uploads—commonly webshells—resulting in full system compromise. The detection looks for HTTP HEAD or POST requests with a 200 OK status to sensitive Visual Composer endpoints, which may indicate reconnaissance or active exploitation. Successful exploitation can lead to attackers gaining privileged access, deploying malware, and impacting business-critical SAP resources. Immediate patching and investigation of suspicious activity are strongly recommended, as this vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild.
