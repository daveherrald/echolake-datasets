  description: The following analytic detects suspicious DLL modules loaded by calc.exe
    that are not located in the %systemroot%\system32 or %systemroot%\sysWoW64 directories.
    This detection leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to identify DLL side-loading, a technique
    often used by Qakbot malware to execute malicious DLLs. This activity is significant
    as it indicates potential malware execution through a trusted process, which can
    bypass security controls. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to
    execute
