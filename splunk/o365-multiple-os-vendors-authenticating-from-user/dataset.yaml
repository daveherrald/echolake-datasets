  description: The following analytic identifies when multiple operating systems are
    used to authenticate to Azure/EntraID/Office 365 by the same user account over
    a short period of time. This activity could be indicative of attackers enumerating
    various logon capabilities of Azure/EntraID/Office 365 and attempting to discover
    weaknesses in the organizational MFA or conditional access configurations. Usage
    of the tools like "MFASweep" will trigger this detection.
