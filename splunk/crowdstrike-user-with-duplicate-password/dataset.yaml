  description: The following analytic detects CrowdStrike alerts for non-admin accounts
    with duplicate password risk, identifying instances where multiple non-admin users
    share the same password. This practice weakens security and increases the potential
    for unauthorized access. Addressing these alerts is essential to ensure each user
    account has a unique, strong password, thereby enhancing overall security and
    protecting sensitive information.
