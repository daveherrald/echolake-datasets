  description: The following analytic detects outbound connections to commonly abused
    file sharing and pastebin-style hosting domains. It leverages Cisco Secure Firewall
    Threat Defense logs and focuses on allowed connections (action=Allow) where the
    url field matches a list of known data hosting or temporary storage services.
    While many of these platforms serve legitimate purposes, they are frequently leveraged
    by adversaries for malware delivery, data exfiltration, command and control (C2)
    beacons, or staging
