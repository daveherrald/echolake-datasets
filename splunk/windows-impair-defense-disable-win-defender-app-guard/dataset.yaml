  description: 'The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
    that disable Windows Defender Application Guard auditing. It leverages data from
    the Endpoint.Registry data model, focusing on specific registry paths and values.

    and threat detection within the isolated environment, making it easier for malicious
    activities to go unnoticed. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow attackers
    to bypass '
