  description: The following analytic identifies a process command line querying the
    CachedLogonsCount registry value in the Winlogon registry. This detection leverages
    data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line
    executions and registry queries. Monitoring this activity is significant as it
    can indicate the use of post-exploitation tools like Winpeas, which gather information
    about login caching settings. If confirmed malicious, this activity could help
    attackers understand
