  description: The following analytic detects the creation of SSH key files in the
    ~/.ssh/ directory. It leverages filesystem data to identify new files in this
    specific path. This activity is significant because threat actors often create
    SSH keys to gain persistent access and escalate privileges on a compromised host.
    If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to remotely access the machine
    using the OpenSSH daemon service, leading to potential unauthorized control and
    data exfiltration.
