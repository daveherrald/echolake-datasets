  version: 7.0.0
  description: The following analytic identifies a spike in the number of AWS Security
    Hub alerts for an EC2 instance within a 4-hour interval. It leverages AWS Security
    Hub findings data, calculating the average and standard deviation of alerts to
    detect anomalies. This activity is significant for a SOC as a sudden increase
    in alerts may indicate potential security incidents or misconfigurations requiring
    immediate attention. If confirmed malicious, this could signify an ongoing attack,
    leading to unauthorize
