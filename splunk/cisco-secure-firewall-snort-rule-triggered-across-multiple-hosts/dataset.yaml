  description: This analytic identifies Snort intrusion signatures that have been
    triggered by ten or more distinct internal IP addresses within a one-hour window.
    It leverages Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense logs and focuses on the IntrusionEvent
    event type to detect activity that may indicate broad targeting or mass exploitation

    propagation, or automated exploitation of known vulnerabilities across multiple
    systems. If confirm
