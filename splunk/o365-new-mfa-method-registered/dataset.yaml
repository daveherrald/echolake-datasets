  description: The following analytic detects the registration of a new Multi-Factor
    Authentication (MFA) method for a user account within Office 365. It leverages
    O365 audit logs to identify changes in MFA configurations. This activity is significant
    as it may indicate an attacker's attempt to maintain persistence on a compromised
    account. If confirmed malicious, the attacker could bypass existing security measures,
    solidify their access, and potentially escalate privileges or access sensitive
    data. Immediate
