  description: This analytic employs the 3-sigma approach to identify distributed
    password spray attacks. A distributed password spray attack is a type of brute
    force attack where the attacker attempts a few common passwords against many different
    accounts, connecting from multiple IP addresses to avoid detection. By utilizing
    the Authentication Data Model, this detection is effective for all CIM-mapped
    authentication events, providing comprehensive coverage and enhancing security
    against these attacks.
