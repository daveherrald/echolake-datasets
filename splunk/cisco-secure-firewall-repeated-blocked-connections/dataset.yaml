  description: The following analytic detects repeated blocked connection attempts
    from the same initiator to the same responder within a short time window. It leverages
    Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense logs and identifies connections where the
    action is set to Block, and the number of occurrences reaches or exceeds a threshold
    of ten within a one-minute span. This pattern may indicate a misconfigured application,
    unauthorized access attempts, or early stages of a brute-force or scanning operation.
