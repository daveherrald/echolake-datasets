  version: 9.0.0
  description: The following analytic identifies the use of cleartext protocols that
    risk leaking sensitive information. It detects network traffic on legacy protocols
    such as Telnet (port 23), POP3 (port 110), IMAP (port 143), and non-anonymous
    FTP (port 21). The detection leverages the Network_Traffic data model to identify
    TCP traffic on these ports. Monitoring this activity is crucial as it can expose
    credentials and other sensitive data to interception. If confirmed malicious,
    attackers could capture auth
