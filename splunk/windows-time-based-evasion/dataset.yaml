  description: The following analytic detects potentially malicious processes that
    initiate a ping delay using an invalid IP address. It leverages data from Endpoint
    Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions involving
    "ping 0 -n". This behavior is significant as it is commonly used by malware like
    NJRAT to introduce time delays for evasion tactics, such as delaying self-deletion.
