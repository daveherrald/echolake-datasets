  description: The following analytic detects instances where a shell is spawned within
    a Kubernetes container. Leveraging Falco, a cloud-native runtime security tool,
    this analytic monitors system calls within the Kubernetes environment and flags
    when a shell is spawned. This activity is significant for a SOC as it may indicate
    unauthorized access, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, manipulate
    container processes, or escalate privileges. If confirmed malicious, this could
    lead to data breache
