  description: The following analytic detects the use of 'schtasks.exe' to start a
    Scheduled Task on a remote endpoint. This detection leverages Endpoint Detection
    and Response (EDR) data, focusing on process details such as process name, parent
    process, and command-line executions. This activity is significant as adversaries
    often abuse Task Scheduler for lateral movement and remote code execution. If
    confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
    code remotely, potentially lead
