  description: The following analytic detects suspicious access or modification of
    the sshd_config file on Linux systems. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
    and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions involving processes
    like "cat," "nano," "vim," and "vi" accessing the sshd_config file. This activity
