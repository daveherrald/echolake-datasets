  description: The following analytic detects the execution of suspicious PowerShell
    commands associated with Meterpreter modules, such as "MSF.Powershell" and "MSF.Powershell.Meterpreter".
    It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to capture and analyze
    the full command sent to PowerShell. This activity is significant as it indicates
    potential post-exploitation actions, including credential dumping and persistence
    mechanisms. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain extensive control
