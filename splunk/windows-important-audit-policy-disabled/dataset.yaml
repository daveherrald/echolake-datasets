  description: The following analytic detects the disabling of important audit policies.
    It leverages EventCode 4719 from Windows Security Event Logs to identify changes
    where success or failure auditing is removed. This activity is significant as
    it suggests an attacker may have gained access to the domain controller and is
    attempting to evade detection by tampering with audit policies. If confirmed malicious,
    this could lead to severe consequences, including data theft, privilege escalation,
    and full network
