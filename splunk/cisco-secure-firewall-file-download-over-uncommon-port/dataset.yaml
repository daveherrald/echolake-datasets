  description: 'The following analytic detects file transfers flagged as malware that
    occurred over non-standard ports (other than 80 and 443). Adversaries may attempt
    to bypass protocol-based detection or use alternate ports to blend in with other
    traffic. This analytic identifies these non-conventional flows and surfaces potential
    evasion techniques. If confirmed malicious this indicate potential malware delivery
    or other nefarious activity.
