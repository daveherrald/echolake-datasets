  description: The following analytic detects the execution of odbcconf.exe with the
    regsvr action to load a DLL. This is identified by monitoring command-line arguments
    in process creation logs from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. This
    activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary code
    via DLL loading, a common technique used in various attack vectors. If confirmed
    malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute code with the privileges of
    the odbcconf.exe process
