  description: The following analytic detects the execution of reg.exe with the "restore"
    parameter, indicating an attempt to restore registry backup data on a host. This
    detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
    on process execution logs and command-line arguments. This activity is significant
    as it may indicate post-exploitation actions, such as those performed by tools
    like winpeas, which use "reg save" and "reg restore" to manipulate registry settings.
