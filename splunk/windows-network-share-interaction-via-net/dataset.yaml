  description: The following analytic identifies network share discovery and collection
    activities performed on Windows systems using the Net command. Attackers often
    use network share discovery to identify accessible shared resources within a network,
    which can be a precursor to privilege escalation or data exfiltration. By monitoring
    Windows Event Logs for the usage of the Net command to list and interact with
    network shares, this detection helps identify potential reconnaissance and collection
    activities.
