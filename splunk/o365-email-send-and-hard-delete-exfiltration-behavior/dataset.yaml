  version: 2.0.0
  description: The following analytic identifies when an O365 email account sends
    and then hard deletes an email to an external recipient within a short period
    (within 1 hour). This behavior may indicate a compromised account where the threat
    actor is attempting to remove forensic artifacts or evidence of exfiltration activity.
    This behavior is often seen when threat actors want to reduce the probability
    of detection by the compromised account owner.
