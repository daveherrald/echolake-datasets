  description: The following analytic detects the execution of `whoami.exe` without
    any arguments. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
    focusing on process execution logs. This activity is significant because both
    Red Teams and adversaries use `whoami.exe` to identify the current logged-in user,
    aiding in situational awareness and Active Directory discovery. If confirmed malicious,
    this behavior could indicate an attacker is gathering information to further compromise
    the system
