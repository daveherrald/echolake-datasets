  description: The following analytic identifies four or more distinct post-exploitation
    behaviors on a Windows system. It leverages data from the Risk data model in Splunk
    Enterprise Security, focusing on multiple risk events and their associated MITRE
    ATT&CK tactics and techniques. This activity is significant as it indicates potential
    malicious actions following an initial compromise, such as persistence, privilege
    escalation, or data exfiltration. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could
    allow attackers
