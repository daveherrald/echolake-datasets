# Windows Snake Malware Kernel Driver Comadmin

**Type:** TTP

**Author:** Michael Haag, Splunk

## Description

The following analytic detects the creation of the comadmin.dat file in the %windows%\system32\Com directory, which is associated with Snake Malware. This detection leverages the Endpoint.Filesystem data model to identify file creation events matching the specified path and filename. This activity is significant because the comadmin.dat file is part of Snake Malware's installation process, which includes dropping a kernel driver and a custom DLL. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to load a malicious driver, potentially leading to privilege escalation and persistent access to the compromised system.
