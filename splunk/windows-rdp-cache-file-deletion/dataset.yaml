  description: "This detection identifies the deletion of RDP bitmap cache files\u2014\
    specifically .bmc and .bin files\u2014typically stored in the user profile under\
    \ the Terminal Server Client\\Cache directory. These files are created by the\
    \ native Windows Remote Desktop Client (mstsc.exe) and store graphical elements\
    \ from remote sessions to improve performance. Deleting these files may indicate\
