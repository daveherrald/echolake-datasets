  description: 'The following analytic detects when AWS S3 bucket versioning is suspended
    by a user. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to identify `PutBucketVersioning`
    events with the `VersioningConfiguration.Status` set to `Suspended`. This activity
    is significant because disabling versioning can prevent recovery of deleted or
    modified data, which is a common tactic in ransomware attacks. If confirmed malicious,
    this action could lead to data loss and hinder recovery efforts, severely impacting
    data integrity '
