  description: The following analytic detects the use of the base64 decode command
    on Linux systems, which is often used to deobfuscate files. It leverages data
    from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions
    that include "base64 -d" or "base64 --decode". This activity is significant as
    it may indicate an attempt to hide malicious payloads or scripts. If confirmed
    malicious, an attacker could use this technique to execute hidden code, potentially
    leading to unauthorized a
