  version: 7.0.0
  description: The following analytic detects the creation of an AWS DataSync task,
    which could indicate potential data exfiltration. It leverages AWS CloudTrail
    logs to identify the `CreateTask` event from the DataSync service. This activity
    is significant because attackers can misuse DataSync to transfer sensitive data
    from a private AWS location to a public one, leading to data compromise. If confirmed
    malicious, this could result in unauthorized access to sensitive information,
    causing severe data breaches
