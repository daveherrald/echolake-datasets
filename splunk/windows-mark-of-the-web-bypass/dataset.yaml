  description: 'The following analytic identifies a suspicious process that deletes
    the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) data stream. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 23 to detect
    when a file''s Zone.Identifier stream is removed. This activity is significant
    because it is a common technique used by malware, such as Ave Maria RAT, to bypass
    security restrictions on files downloaded from the internet. If confirmed malicious,
    this behavior could allow an attacker to execute potentially harmful files without
    triggering security '
