  description: The following analytic detects the use of Impacket's `wmiexec.py` tool
    for lateral movement by identifying specific command-line parameters. It leverages
    data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on processes
    spawned by `wmiprvse.exe` with command-line patterns indicative of Impacket usage.
    This activity is significant as Impacket tools are commonly used by adversaries
    for remote code execution and lateral movement within a network. If confirmed
    malicious, this could allow
