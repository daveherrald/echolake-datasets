  description: The following analytic detects network share access requests indicative
    of the PetitPotam attack (CVE-2021-36942). It leverages Windows Event Code 5145,
    which logs attempts to access network share objects. This detection is significant
    as PetitPotam can coerce authentication from domain controllers, potentially leading
    to unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers
    to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network, posing a severe security
    risk. Ens
