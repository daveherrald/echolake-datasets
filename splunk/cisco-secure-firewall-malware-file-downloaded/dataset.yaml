  description: 'The following analytic detects file downloads that were classified
    as malware by Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense. It relies on the `SHA_Disposition`
    field with a value of "Malware" and includes metadata such as file name, file_hash
    hash, and threat classification. This analytic is critical for surfacing file-based
    threats that are identified via Cisco''s AMP or Threat Grid integrations. If confirmed
    malicious, this could indicate delivery of malware.
