  description: The following analytic detects the creation of a symlink to a shadow
    copy, which may indicate credential dumping attempts. It leverages the Endpoint.Processes
    data model in Splunk to identify processes executing commands containing "mklink"
    and "HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy". This activity is significant because attackers
    often use this technique to manipulate or delete shadow copies, hindering system
    backup and recovery efforts. If confirmed malicious, this could prevent data restoration,
