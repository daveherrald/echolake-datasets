  description: 'This analytic detects intrusion events from known threat activity
    using Cisco Secure Firewall Intrusion Events.

    It leverages Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense IntrusionEvent logs to identify
    cases where one or multiple Snort signatures

    associated with a known threat or threat actor activity have been triggered within
    a one-hour time window. The detection uses a

    lookup table (cisco_snort_ids_to_threat_mapping) to map Snort signature IDs to
    known threat actors and their techniques.
