  description: This detection identifies the installation of developer-signed MSIX
    packages that lack Microsoft Store signatures. All malicious MSIX packages observed
    in recent threat campaigns (including those from FIN7, Zloader/Storm-0569, and
    FakeBat/Storm-1113) were developer-signed rather than Microsoft Store signed.
    Microsoft Store apps have specific publisher IDs containing '8wekyb3d8bbwe' or
    'cw5n1h2txyewy', while developer-signed packages lack these identifiers. This
    detection focuses on EventID 855 f
