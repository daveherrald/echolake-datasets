  description: This analytic identifies a suspicious spawned process by WScript or
    CScript process. This technique was a common technique used by adversaries and
    malware to execute different LOLBIN, other scripts like PowerShell or spawn a
    suspended process to inject its code as a defense evasion. This TTP may detect
    some normal script that uses several application tools that are in the list of
    the child process it detects but a good pivot and indicator that a script may
    execute suspicious code.
