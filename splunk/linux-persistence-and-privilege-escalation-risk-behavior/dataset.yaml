  description: The following analytic identifies potential Linux persistence and privilege
    escalation activities. It leverages risk scores and event counts from various
    Linux-related data sources, focusing on tactics associated with persistence and
    privilege escalation. This activity is significant for a SOC because it highlights
    behaviors that could allow an attacker to maintain access or gain elevated privileges
    on a Linux system. If confirmed malicious, this activity could enable an attacker
    to execute code
