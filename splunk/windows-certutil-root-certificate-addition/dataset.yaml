  description: 'The following analytic detects the use of certutil.exe to add a certificate
    to the Root certificate store using the "-addstore" flag.

    In this case, the certificate is loaded from a temporary file path (e.g., %TEMP%)
    or other uncommon locations (e.g. C:\\Users\\Public\\), which is highly suspicious
    and uncommon in legitimate administrative activity.

    This behavior may indicate an adversary is installing a malicious root certificate
    to intercept HTTPS traffic, impersonate trusted entities, or bypas'
