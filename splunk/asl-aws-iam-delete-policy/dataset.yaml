  description: The following analytic identifies when a policy is deleted in AWS.
    It leverages Amazon Security Lake logs to detect the DeletePolicy API operation.
    Monitoring policy deletions is crucial as it can indicate unauthorized attempts
    to weaken security controls. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow
    an attacker to remove critical security policies, potentially leading to privilege
    escalation or unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
