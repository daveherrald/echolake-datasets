  description: The following analytic identifies the provisioning of a new MFA device
    shortly after a password reset. It detects this activity by correlating Windows
    Event Log events for password changes (EventID 4723, 4724) with PingID logs indicating
    device pairing. This behavior is significant as it may indicate a social engineering
    attack where a threat actor impersonates a valid user to reset credentials and
    add a new MFA device. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker
    to gain persis
