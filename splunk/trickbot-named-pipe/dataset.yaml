  description: The following analytic detects the creation or connection to a named
    pipe associated with Trickbot malware. It leverages Sysmon EventCodes 17 and 18
    to identify named pipes with the pattern "\\pipe\\*lacesomepipe". This activity
    is significant as Trickbot uses named pipes for communication with its command
    and control (C2) servers, facilitating data exfiltration and command execution.
    If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to maintain persistence,
    execute arbitrary commands,
