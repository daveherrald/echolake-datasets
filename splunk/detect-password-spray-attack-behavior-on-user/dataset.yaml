  description: The following analytic identifies any user failing to authenticate
    from 10 or more unique sources. This behavior could represent an adversary performing
    a Password Spraying attack to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. This
    logic can be used for real time security monitoring as well as threat hunting
    exercises. Environments can be very different depending on the organization. Test
    and customize this detections thresholds as needed
