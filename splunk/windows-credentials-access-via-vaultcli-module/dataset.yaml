  description: The following analytic detects potentially abnormal interactions with
    VaultCLI.dll, particularly those initiated by processes located in publicly writable
    Windows folder paths. The VaultCLI.dll module allows processes to extract credentials
    from the Windows Credential Vault. It was seen being abused by information stealers
    such as Meduza. The analytic monitors suspicious API calls, unauthorized credential
    access patterns, and anomalous process behaviors indicative of malicious activity.
