  description: 'This analytic identifies Snort signatures that have triggered only
    once in the past 7 days across all Cisco Secure Firewall IntrusionEvent logs.
    While these rules typically do not trigger in day-to-day network activity, their
    sudden appearance may indicate early-stage compromise, previously unseen malware,
    or reconnaissance activity against less commonly exposed services. Investigating
    these outliers can provide valuable insight into new or low-noise adversary behaviors.
