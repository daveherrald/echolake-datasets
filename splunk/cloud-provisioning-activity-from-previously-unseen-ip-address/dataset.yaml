  version: 5.0.0
  description: The following analytic detects cloud provisioning activities originating
    from previously unseen IP addresses. It leverages cloud infrastructure logs to
    identify events where resources are created or started, and cross-references these
    with a baseline of known IP addresses. This activity is significant as it may
    indicate unauthorized access or potential misuse of cloud resources. If confirmed
    malicious, an attacker could gain unauthorized control over cloud resources, leading
    to data breaches, se
