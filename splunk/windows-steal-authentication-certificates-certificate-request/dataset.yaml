  description: The following analytic detects when a new certificate is requested
    from Certificate Services - AD CS. It leverages Event ID 4886, which indicates
    that a certificate request has been received. This activity is significant because
    unauthorized certificate requests can be part of credential theft or lateral movement
    tactics. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could use the certificate to impersonate
    users, gain unauthorized access to resources, or establish persistent access within
    the environment
