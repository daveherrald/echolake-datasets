  description: 'The following analytic detects the loading of a DLL using the regsvr32
    application with the silent parameter and DLLInstall execution. It leverages data
    from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process command-line
    arguments and parent process details. This activity is significant as it is commonly
    used by RAT malware like Remcos and njRAT to load malicious DLLs on compromised
    machines. If confirmed malicious, this technique could allow attackers to execute
    arbitrary code, '
