  description: The following analytic detects when an unusual number of NTLM authentications
    is attempted by the same user account against multiple destinations. This activity
    generally results when an attacker attempts to brute force, password spray, or
    otherwise authenticate to numerous domain joined Windows devices using an NTLM
    based process/attack. This same activity may also generate a large number of EventID
    4776 events as well.
