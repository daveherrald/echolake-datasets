  version: 7.0.0
  description: The following analytic detects the creation of the /etc/at.allow or
    /etc/at.deny configuration files in Linux. It leverages file creation events from
    the Endpoint datamodel to identify when these files are created. This activity
    is significant as these files control user permissions for the "at" scheduling
    application and can be abused by attackers to establish persistence. If confirmed
    malicious, this could allow unauthorized execution of malicious code, leading
    to potential data theft or furth
