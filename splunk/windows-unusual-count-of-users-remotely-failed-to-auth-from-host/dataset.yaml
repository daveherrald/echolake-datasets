  description: The following analytic identifies a source host failing to authenticate
    against a remote host with multiple users, potentially indicating a Password Spraying
    attack. It leverages Windows Event 4625 (failed logon attempts) and Logon Type
    3 (remote authentication) to detect this behavior. This activity is significant
    as it may represent an adversary attempting to gain initial access or elevate
    privileges within an Active Directory environment. If confirmed malicious, this
    could lead to unauthorize
