  description: The following analytic identifies a source endpoint failing to authenticate
    with multiple invalid users using the NTLM protocol. It leverages EventCode 4776
    and calculates the standard deviation for each host, using the 3-sigma rule to
    detect anomalies. This behavior is significant as it may indicate a Password Spraying
    attack, where an adversary attempts to gain initial access or elevate privileges.
    If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access or privilege
    escalation,
