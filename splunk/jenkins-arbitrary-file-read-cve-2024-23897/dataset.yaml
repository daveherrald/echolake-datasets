  description: The following analytic identifies attempts to exploit Jenkins Arbitrary
    File Read CVE-2024-23897. It detects HTTP POST requests to Jenkins URLs containing
    "*/cli?remoting=false*" with a 200 status code. This activity is significant as
    it indicates potential unauthorized access to sensitive files on the Jenkins server,
    such as credentials and private keys. If confirmed malicious, this could lead
    to severe data breaches, unauthorized access, and further exploitation within
    the environment.
