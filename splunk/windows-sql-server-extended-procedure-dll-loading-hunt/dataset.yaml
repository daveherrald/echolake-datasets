  description: This analytic detects when SQL Server loads DLLs to execute extended
    stored procedures. This is particularly important for security monitoring as it
    indicates the first-time use or version changes of potentially dangerous procedures
    like xp_cmdshell, sp_OACreate, and others. While this is a legitimate operation,
    adversaries may abuse these procedures for execution, discovery, or privilege
    escalation.
