  description: 'The following analytic identifies excessive security scanning activities
    in AWS by detecting a high number of Describe, List, or Get API calls from a single
    user. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to count distinct event names and flags
    users with more than 50 such events. This behavior is significant as it may indicate
    reconnaissance activities by an attacker attempting to map out your AWS environment.
    If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration,
    or further '
