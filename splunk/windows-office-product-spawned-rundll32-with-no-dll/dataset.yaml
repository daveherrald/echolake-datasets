  description: The following analytic detects any Windows Office Product spawning
    `rundll32.exe` without a `.dll` file extension. This behavior is identified using
    Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process and parent
    process relationships. This activity is significant as it is a known tactic of
    the IcedID malware family, which can lead to unauthorized code execution. If confirmed
    malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading
    to data exfiltration
