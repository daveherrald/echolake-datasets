  description: The following analytic identifies the creation or modification of Image
    File Execution Options (IFEO) registry keys, detected via EventCode 3000 in the
    Application channel. This detection leverages Windows Event Logs to monitor for
    process names added to IFEO under specific registry paths. This activity is significant
    as it can indicate attempts to set traps for process monitoring or debugging,
    often used by attackers for persistence or evasion. If confirmed malicious, this
    could allow an attack
