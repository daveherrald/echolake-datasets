  description: 'The following analytic detects use of container images that fall outside
    an approved

    allowlist, leveraging Cisco Isovalent/Tetragon runtime telemetry (image name and

    workload identity). Adversaries commonly introduce untrusted or newly published

    images to deploy tooling, establish persistence, or abuse supply‑chain trust.
    This

    behavior may indicate image pulls from unauthorized registries, execution of

    unvetted software, or a drift from established deployment baselines. Extra scrutiny

    is warrant'
