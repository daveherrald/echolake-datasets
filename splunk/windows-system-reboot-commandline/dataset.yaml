  description: The following analytic identifies the execution of the Windows command
    line to reboot a host machine using "shutdown.exe" with specific parameters. This
    detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
    on process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant as it
    is often associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs) and remote access
    trojans (RATs) like dcrat, which may use system reboots to disrupt operations,
    aid in system destruction
