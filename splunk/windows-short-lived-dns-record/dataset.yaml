  description: The following analytic identifies the creation and quick deletion of
    a DNS object within 300 seconds in an Active Directory environment, indicative
    of a potential attack abusing DNS. This detection leverages Windows Security Event
    Codes 5136 and 5137, analyzing the duration between these events. This activity
    is significant as temporary DNS entries allows attackers to cause unexpecting
    network trafficking, leading to potential compromise.
