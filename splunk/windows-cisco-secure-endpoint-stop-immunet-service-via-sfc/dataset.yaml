  description: The following analytic detects the use of the `sfc.exe` utility, in
    order to stop the Immunet Protect service. The Sfc.exe utility is part of Cisco
    Secure Endpoint installation. This detection leverages telemetry from the endpoint,
    focusing on command-line executions involving the `-k` parameter. This activity
    is significant as it indicates potential tampering with defensive mechanisms.
    If confirmed malicious, attackers could partially blind the EDR, enabling further
    compromise and lateral movem
