  description: 'The following analytic detects the creation of a suspicious registry
    entry by Qakbot malware, characterized by 8 random registry value names with encrypted
    binary data. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
    (EDR) agents, focusing on registry modifications under the "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\"
    path by processes like explorer.exe. This activity is significant as it indicates
    potential Qakbot infection, which uses the registry to store malicious code or
    configuration data. '
