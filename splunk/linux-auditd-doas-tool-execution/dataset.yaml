  description: 'The following analytic detects the execution of the ''doas'' tool
    on a Linux host. This tool allows standard users to perform tasks with root privileges,
    similar to ''sudo''. The detection leverages data from Linux Auditd, focusing
    on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant as
    ''doas'' can be exploited by adversaries to gain elevated privileges on a compromised
    host. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized administrative access,
    potentially compromising '
