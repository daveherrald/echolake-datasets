  description: 'This analytic detects inbound SSH connections to non-standard ports
    on network devices using Cisco Secure Firewall Intrusion Events. APT actors have
    been observed enabling SSH servers on high, non-default TCP ports to maintain
    encrypted remote access to compromised network infrastructure.

    This detection leverages Snort signature 65369 to identify SSH protocol traffic
    on unusual ports, which may indicate persistence mechanisms or backdoor access
    established by threat actors.
