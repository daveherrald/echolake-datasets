  description: The following analytic detects the execution of `wmic.exe` with command-line
    arguments used to query local user accounts, specifically the `useraccount` argument.
    It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
    on process execution logs that include command-line details. This activity is
    significant as it indicates potential reconnaissance efforts by adversaries to
    enumerate local users, which is a common step in situational awareness and Active
    Directory discovery.
