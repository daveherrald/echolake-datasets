  description: 'The following analytic detects multiple Okta accounts being locked
    out within a short period. It uses the user.account.lock event from Okta logs,
    aggregated over a 5-minute window, to identify this behavior. This activity is
    significant as it may indicate a brute force or password spraying attack, where
    an adversary attempts to guess passwords, leading to account lockouts. If confirmed
    malicious, this could result in potential account takeovers or unauthorized access
    to sensitive Okta accounts, '
