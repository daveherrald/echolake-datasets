  description: Detects potential Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks or rate
    limit abuse against Ollama API endpoints by identifying excessive request volumes
    from individual client IP addresses. This detection monitors GIN-formatted Ollama
    server logs to identify clients generating abnormally high request rates within
    short time windows, which may indicate automated attacks, botnet activity, or
    resource exhaustion attempts targeting local AI model infrastructure.
