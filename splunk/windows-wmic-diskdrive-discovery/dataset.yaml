  description: "The following analytic detects the use of Windows Management Instrumentation\
    \ Command-line (WMIC) for disk drive discovery activities on a Windows system.\
    \ This process involves monitoring commands such as \u201Cwmic diskdrive\u201D\
    \ which are often used by administrators for inventory and diagnostics but can\
    \ also be leveraged by attackers to enumerate hardware details for malicious purposes.\
    \ Detecting these commands is essential for identifying potentially unauthorized\
    \ asset reconnaissance or pre-attack map"
