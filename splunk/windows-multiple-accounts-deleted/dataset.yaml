  description: 'The following analytic detects the deletion of more than five unique
    Windows accounts within a 10-minute period, using Event Code 4726 from the Windows
    Security Event Log. It leverages the `wineventlog_security` dataset, segmenting
    data into 10-minute intervals to identify suspicious account deletions. This activity
    is significant as it may indicate an attacker attempting to erase traces of their
    actions. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access removal,
    hindering incident '
