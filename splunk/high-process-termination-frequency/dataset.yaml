  description: The following analytic identifies a high frequency of process termination
    events on a computer within a short period. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 5 logs
    to detect instances where 15 or more processes are terminated within a 3-second
    window. This behavior is significant as it is commonly associated with ransomware
    attempting to avoid exceptions during file encryption. If confirmed malicious,
    this activity could indicate an active ransomware attack, potentially leading
    to widespread file encrypt
