  description: The following analytic detects potential reverse shell activity by
    identifying connections involving ports commonly associated with remote access
    tools, shell listeners, or tunneling utilities. It leverages Cisco Secure Firewall
    Threat Defense logs and monitors destination ports against a list of non-standard,
    high-risk port values often used in post-exploitation scenarios. Adversaries frequently
    configure tools like netcat, Meterpreter, or other backdoors to listen or connect
    over uncommon port
