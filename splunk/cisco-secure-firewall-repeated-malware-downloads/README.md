# Cisco Secure Firewall - Repeated Malware Downloads

**Type:** Anomaly

**Author:** Nasreddine Bencherchali, Splunk

## Description

The following analytic detects repeated malware file downloads initiated by the same internal host (src) within a short time window. It leverages Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense logs and identifies `FileEvent` events with a `SHA_Disposition` of "Malware" and `FileDirection` set to "Download". If ten or more such events occur from the same host within five minutes, this analytic will trigger. This activity may indicate the host is compromised and repeatedly retrieving malicious content either due to command-and-control, malware staging, or automation. If confirmed malicious, this behavior may represent an infection in progress, persistence mechanism, or a malicious downloader.
