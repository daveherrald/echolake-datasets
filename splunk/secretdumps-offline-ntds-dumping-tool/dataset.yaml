  description: The following analytic detects the potential use of the secretsdump.py
    tool to dump NTLM hashes from a copy of ntds.dit and the SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY
    registry hives. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
    focusing on specific command-line patterns and process names associated with secretsdump.py.
    This activity is significant because it indicates an attempt to extract sensitive
    credential information offline, which is a common post-exploitation technique.
