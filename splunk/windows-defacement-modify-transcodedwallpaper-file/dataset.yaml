  description: The following analytic identifies modifications to the TranscodedWallpaper
    file in the wallpaper theme directory, excluding changes made by explorer.exe.
    This detection leverages the Endpoint.Processes and Endpoint.Filesystem data models
    to correlate process activity with file modifications. This activity is significant
    as it may indicate an adversary attempting to deface or change the desktop wallpaper
    of a targeted host, a tactic often used to signal compromise or deliver a message.
    If confirm
